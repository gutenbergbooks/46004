<h2 id="c1">ON THE ROOF OF THE WORLD</h2>
<div class="pb" id="Page_3">[3]</div>
<p>It seemed to be the very roof of the world,
all naked to the outer cold, this flat vast
of solitude, dimly outspread beneath the Arctic
night. A line of little hills, mere knobs and
hummocks, insignificant under the bitter starlight,
served to emphasize the immeasurable and
shelterless flatness of the surrounding expanse.
Somewhere beneath the unfeatured levels the sea
ended and the land began, but over all lay the
monotony of ridged ice and icy, wind-scourged
snow. The wind, which for weeks without a
pause had torn screaming across the nakedness,
had now dropped into calm; and with the calm
there seemed to come in the unspeakable cold of
space.</p>
<p>Suddenly a sharp noise, beginning in the dimness
far to the left of the Little Hills, ran snapping
past them and died off abruptly in the distance
to the right. It was the ice, thickened under
that terrific cold, breaking in order to readjust itself
to the new pressure. There was a moment
of strange muttering and grinding. Then, again,
the stillness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">[4]</div>
<p>Yet, even here on the roof of the world, which
seemed as if all the winds of eternity had swept it
bare, there was life, life that clutched and clung
savagely. Away to the right of the Little Hills,
something moved, prowling slowly among the long
ridges of the ice. It was a gaunt, white, slouching,
startling shape, some seven or eight feet in
length, and nearly four in height, with heavy
shoulders, and a narrow, flat-browed head that
hung low and swayed menacingly from side to
side as it went. Had the light been anything
more than the wide glimmer of stars, it would
have shown that this lonely, prowling shape of
white had a black-tipped muzzle, black edges
to the long slit of its jaws, and little, cruel eyes
with lids outlined in black. From time to time
the prowler raised his head, sniffed with dilating
nostrils, and questioned with strained ears the
deathly silence. It was a polar bear, an old male,
too restless and morose to content himself with
sleeping away the terrible polar winter in a snow-blanketed
hole.</p>
<p>From somewhere far off to seaward came across
the stillness a light sound, the breaking of thin
ice, the tinkle of splashings frozen as they fell.
The great white bear understood that sound.
He had been waiting for it. The seals were
breaking their way up into their air-holes to
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
breathe&mdash;those curious holes which form here
and there in the ice-fields over moving water, as
if the ocean itself had need of keeping in touch
with upper air for its immeasurable breathing.
At a great pace, but noiselessly as a drifting wraith
of snow, the bear went towards the sound. Then
suddenly he dropped flat and seemed to vanish.
In reality he was crawling, crawling steadily
towards the place of the air-holes. But so smooth
was his movement, so furtive, and so fitted to
every irregularity of the icy surface, that if the
eye once lost him it might strive in vain to pick
him up again.</p>
<p>Nearer, nearer he crept, till at last, lying
motionless with his lean muzzle just over the
crest of the ice-ridge, he could make out the dark
shapes of the seals, vague as shadows, emerging
for a few moments to sprawl upon the edge of
the ice. Every few seconds one would slip into
the water again, while another would awkwardly
scramble forth. In that phenomenal cold it was
necessary for them to take heed to the air-holes,
lest these should get sealed up and leave them to
drown helplessly under the leagues of solid ice-field.
These breathing-spells in the upper air,
out here on the world&rsquo;s roof, were their moments
of greatest peril. Close to the edge of the hole
they sprawled; and always one or another kept
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
anxious watch, scanning with mild, bright eyes
the menacing solitude, wherein they seemed the
only things alive.</p>
<p>About this time, from one of a group of tiny,
snow-covered mounds huddled along the base of
the Little Hills, emerged a man. He crawled
forth on all fours from the tunnel of his doorway,
and stood up and peered about him. His squat
figure was clothed and hooded in furs. His little,
twinkling eyes, after clearing themselves from the
smoke and smart of the thick air within the igloo,
could see further through the gloom than even
the eyes of the bear. He noted the fall of the
wind, the savage intensity of the cold, and his
eyes brightened with hope. He had no fear of
the cold, but he feared the hunger which was
threatening the lonely village. During the long
rage of the wind, the supply of food in his igloo
had run low. He welcomed a cold which would
close up most of the seals&rsquo; breathing-holes, and
force more numerous visitors to the few holes
that they could keep open. For some moments
he stood motionless, peering and listening as the
bear had done. Suddenly he too caught that far-off
light crashing of brittle ice. On the instant
he turned and crawled hastily back into the hut.</p>
<p>A moment later he reappeared, carrying two
weapons, besides the long knife stuck in his girdle.
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
One of these was an old Hudson Bay Company&rsquo;s
musket. The other was a spear of spliced bone,
with a steel head securely lashed to it. Powder
and ball for the musket were much too precious
to be expended, except in some emergency wherein
the spear might fail. Without waiting for a repetition
of the sounds, he started off at once unerringly
in the direction whence they had come.
He knew that air-hole; he could find it in the
delusive gloom without the aid of landmark. For
some way he went erect and in haste, though as
soundlessly as the bear. Then, throwing himself
flat, he followed exactly the bear&rsquo;s tactics, till, at
last, peering cautiously over a jagged ice-ridge,
he, too, could make out the quarry watchfully
coming and going about the brink of the air-hole.</p>
<p>From this point onward the man&rsquo;s movements
were so slow as to be almost imperceptible. But
for his thick covering of furs, his skin tough as
leather and reeking with oil, he would have been
frozen in the midst of his journey. But the still
excitement of the hunt was pumping the blood
hotly through his veins. He was now within
gunshot, but in that dim light his shooting would
be uncertain. He preferred to worm his way
nearer, and then trust to his more accustomed
weapon, the spear, which he could drive half-way
through the tough bulk of a walrus.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">[8]</div>
<p>At last there remained between him and the
seals but one low ridge and then a space of level
floe. This was the critical point. If he could
writhe his body over the crest and down the other
side, he would be within safe spear-shot. He
would spring to his feet and throw before the
nimblest seal could gain the water. He lay absolutely
still, summoning wits, nerves, and muscles
alike to serve his will with their best. His
eyes burned deep in his head, like smouldering
coals.</p>
<p>Just at this moment a ghostly light waved
broadly across the solitude. It paled, withdrew,
wavered back and forth as shaken from a curtain
in the heavens, then steadied ephemerally into an
arch of glowing silver, which threw the light of a
dozen moons. There were three seals out upon
the ice at that moment, and they all lifted their
eyes simultaneously to greet the illumination.
The man irresistibly looked up; but in the same
instant, remembering the hunger in the igloo, he
cowered back again out of sight, trembling lest
some of the seals might have caught a glimpse of
his head above the ridge. Some dozen rods away,
at the other side of the air-hole, the great white
bear also raised his eyes towards that mysterious
light, troubled at heart because he knew it was
going to hamper his hunting.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">[9]</div>
<p>For perhaps two minutes the seals were
motionless, profiting by the sudden brightness to
scrutinize the expanse of ice and snow in every
direction. Then, quite satisfied that no danger
was near, they resumed their sportive plungings
while the instantly frozen waters crackled crisply
about them. For all their vigilance, they had
failed to detect, on the one side, a narrow, black-tipped
muzzle lying flat in a cleft of the ice-ridge,
or, on the other side, a bunch of grayish fur,
nearly the color of the grayish-mottled ice,
which covered the head of the man from the igloo
beside the Little Hills.</p>
<p>And now, while neither the man nor the bear,
each utterly unconscious of the other, dared to stir,
in a flash the still silver radiance of the aurora broke
up and flamed into a riot of dancing color. Parallel
rays like the pipes of a Titanic organ, reaching
almost from the horizon to the zenith, hurtled
madly from side to side, now elongating, now
shortening abruptly, now seeming to clash against
one another, but always in an ordered madness of
right lines. Unearthly green, palpitating into
rose, and thinnest sapphire, and flame-color, and
ineffably tender violet, the dance of these cohorts
of the magnetic rays went on, across the stupendous
arc of sky, till the man, afraid of freezing
in his unnatural stillness, shrank back down the
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
ridge, and began twisting his body, noiselessly but
violently, to set his blood in motion; and the bear,
trusting to the confusion of shifting lights, slipped
himself over the ridge and into a convenient
crevice. Under the full but bewildering glare of
that celestial illumination, he had gained a good
ten feet upon his human rival. The man&rsquo;s eyes
reappeared just then at the crest of his ridge.
Their piercing glance lingered, as if with suspicion,
upon the crevice wherein the bear had flattened
himself. Was there something unduly solid in
that purple shadow in the crevice? No, a
trick of the witch lights, surely. The piercing
eyes returned to their eager watching of the
seals.</p>
<p>Precious as was his ammunition, and indifferent
as was his shooting with the old, big bore, Hudson
Bay musket, the man was beginning to think
he would have to stake his chances on the gun.
But, suddenly, as if at a handsweep of the Infinite,
the great lights vanished.</p>
<p>For a few seconds, by the violence of the contrast,
it seemed as if thick darkness had fallen
upon the world.</p>
<p>In those few seconds, noiseless and swift as a
panther, the man had run over the ridge to within
a dozen paces of the seals, and paused with spear
uplifted, waiting till his eyes should once more
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
be able to see in the starlight glimmer. As he
stood thus waiting, every sense, nerve, and
muscle on the last strain of expectancy and readiness,
he heard, or seemed to feel as much as to
hear, the rush of some great bulk through the
gloom. Then came a scramble, a heavy splash, a
second splash, a terrible scuffling noise, and a
hoarse, barking scream. The man remembered
that before the light went out there had been three
seals on the ice. Two he had heard escape.
What had befallen the third? Fiercely, like a
beast being robbed of its prey, he sprang forward
a couple of paces. Then he stopped, for he could
not yet see clearly enough to distinguish what was
before him. His blood pounded through his
veins. The cold of Eternity was flowing in upon
him, here on the naked roof of the world, but he
had no feeling or fear of it. All he felt was the
presence of his foe, there before him, close before
him, in the dark.</p>
<p>Then, once more, the light flooded back,&mdash;the
wide-flung silver radiance,&mdash;as suddenly and
mysteriously as it had vanished.</p>
<p>Close beside the air-hole, half crouching upon
the body of the slain seal, with one great paw uplifted,
and bloody jaws open in defiance, stood
the bear, glaring at the man.</p>
<p>Without an instant&rsquo;s hesitation the man hurled
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
his spear. It flew true. But in that same second
the bear lifted his paw to ward off the blow. He
was not quite quick enough, but almost. The
blade struck, but not where it was aimed. It bit
deep, but not to the life. With a growl of rage,
the bear tore it loose and charged upon the
man.</p>
<p>The antagonists were not more than twenty
paces apart, and now a glory of colored lights,
green, red, and golden, went dancing madly over
them, with a whispering, rustling sound as of
stiff silk crumpled in vast folds. The man&rsquo;s eyes
were keen and steady. In a flash both hands were
out of his great fur mittens, which were tied by
thongs to his sleeves. The heavy musket leaped
to his shoulder, and his eye ran coolly along the
barrel. There was a thunderous roar as of a little
cannon. A dense cloud of smoke sprang into the
air just before the muzzle of the gun.</p>
<p>Through the smoke a towering shape, with
wide jaws and battering paws, hurled itself. The
man leaped to one side, but not quite far enough.
One great paw, striking blindly, smote him down;
and, as he fell, the huge bulk fell half upon him,
only to roll over the next instant and lie huddled
and motionless upon the ice.</p>
<p>The man picked himself up, shook himself;
and a look of half-dazed triumph went across his
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
swarthy face as he pulled on his mittens. Then
he smiled broadly, patted approvingly the old
Hudson Bay musket, turned on his heels, and
sent a long, summoning cry across the ice towards
the igloos at the foot of the Little Hills.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">[15]</div>
<h2 id="c2">BLACK SWAMP</h2>
<p>The brook, which had rattled down so gayly,
with many a laughing rapid and clattering
white cascade, from the sunlit granite terraces of
Lost Mountain, fell silent and hung back as it
drew near the swamp. Wheeling in slow, deep,
purple-dark eddies, it loitered for some hundred
yards or so between dim overhanging ranks of
alder, then sank reluctantly beneath an arch of
mossed cedar-roots, and was lost in the heavy
gloom.</p>
<p>Within the swamp the huge and ancient trunks
of cedar and tamarack crowded in a sort of desperate
confusion. Of great girth at the base, some
towered straight up, seeking to get their tops out
into the sunlight, under those sparse patches of
far-off, indifferent sky. Others slanted ponderously,
and laid upon their neighbors the responsibility
of supporting their burden of massive
branches. Yet others, undermined in youth by
some treachery of the slough, lay prone above
the water-holes for a portion of their length, and
then turned skyward, ineffectually, as if too late
awakened from their sluggish dreams. The roots
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
of the trees were half uncovered&mdash;immense, coiled,
uncouth, dull-colored shapes, like monsters struggling
up from the teeming primeval slime.</p>
<p>In truth, there was a suggestion of something
monstrous in all that the eye could see in Black
Swamp. The heavy, indeterminate masses of
dark mud, or patches of black water, lying deep
between and under the contortions of the roots;
the thick, gray rags of dead cedar-bark; the rotting
stumps, some uprooted and half engulfed
in the inert morass; the overpowering windless
shadow, which lay thick as if no sound had ever
jarred it; above all, the gigantic tangle of trunks
and roots, stagnantly motionless, with the strained
stillness that is not of peace, but of a nightmare.
From a branch of one of the sullen trunks hung
a globe of lightest-gray papery substance, with a
round hole in the bottom of it. In and out of
this hole moved two venomous streams of black-and-white
hornets.</p>
<p>Suddenly it seemed as if the spirit of the monstrous
solitude had taken substance, and was moving
among the inert shapes of root and trunk. A
massive fur-clad beast, dull black in color, with
high, humped haunches and heavy, shapeless limbs,
its hind feet grotesquely semi-human in outline, its
head swinging low on a long, clumsy neck, came
picking its way with a loose-jointed gait over the
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
jumble of roots. With little, twinkling, deep-set
eyes it peered beneath each root, investigated each
crevice in the ancient bark, looking for grubs and
beetles, which its great paws captured with amazing
though awkward-looking dexterity. For so
huge a beast as the great black bear, which could
pull down an ox, to busy himself in the hunting
of grubs and beetles, seemed one of the whimsicalities
of Nature, who pursues her ends indifferently
through mammoth or microbe.</p>
<p>Near the tree of the hornets the bear found a
half-rotten stump. Sniffing at it with instructed
nose, he decided that it held grubs. Clutching
at it with his long, hooked claws, he tore away
one side of it, revealing a mellow-brown, crumbly
interior channelled by wood-grubs in every
direction. Those which were in view on the erect
portion of the stump he first picked out delicately
and devoured with satisfaction. Then he turned
his attention to the big slab which he had ripped
away, and which lay on a hummock of firm
ground at his feet.</p>
<p>But the bear was not the only connoisseur of
grubs in Black Swamp. Some dozen inches before
his nose a particularly fat maggot was squirming
in the shallow remnant of its chamber,
dismayed at its sudden exposure to the air.
The bear was just on the point of picking it up,
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
when it was pounced upon by one of the great
black-and-white hornets, as a hawk might pounce
on a rabbit. Pricked with the tip of the hornet&rsquo;s
sting, the fat grub lashed itself out in one convulsive
squirm, and then lay still. Straddling
over it, the hornet rolled it together cleverly,
then, plunging her mandibles into its soft body,
proceeded to drain its juices.</p>
<p>For some moments the bear had watched this
performance with curious interest, his little eyes
twinkling wickedly. Now he had had enough
of the show. Stretching out one mighty paw,
he laid it down deliberately on the hornet and her
prey. For a moment he left it there, as if his
act had been one of considered punishment.
Then, withdrawing the paw, he eyed the flattened
insect, and proceeded to swallow her and her
victim together.</p>
<p>But the hornet was not quite dead, for the
rotten wood was soft and full of unevenness;
and this insect, with its burnished black body
barred with creamy white, was no mere peppery
little &ldquo;yellow-jacket&rdquo; wasp, but the great hornet
of the woods, whose sting can pierce the hide of
the moose. No sooner had the bear picked up
the dangerous morsel than he spat it out again with
a <i>woof</i> of surprise, and ground it into nothingness
with an angry sweep of his paw. Then he fell to
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
shaking his head, clawing awkwardly at his mouth,
and whining a fretful protest at the sting.
Lumbering down to a swamp-hole close by, he
plunged his muzzle again and again into the chill
black mud. After a brief period of this treatment,
he returned to the stump and went on with his
banquet of grubs, stopping every now and then
to shake his head and grumble deep in his throat.
When another big hornet, catching sight of the
feast, pounced upon a grub, he smashed her and
ground her up instantly, without caring how
many tasty morsels were annihilated in the
process.</p>
<p>When the stump had been quite torn to pieces,
and every maggot extracted from it, the bear
moved on to the tree of the hornets. He did
not notice the nest, for he did not take the
trouble to look up. If he had done so, being in
a rage against the venomous tribe, he might, perhaps,
have had the rashness to climb the tree and
declare a doubtful war. As it was, he noted only
that between two great roots, which sprang out
like buttresses from the base of the trunk, there
was a space of dry earth, covered with the minute
elastic needles of the tamarack. Here he threw
himself down with a grunt, and fell to rubbing
his face with his thick forepaws.</p>
<p>But he was restless, the old bear&mdash;either because
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
the grubs had not satisfied his hunger, or
because the sting of the hornet still rankled in
his jaw. Almost immediately he got up upon
his haunches, and stared all about, sniffing, with
his nose in the air. The monstrous confusion
of roots and trunks, monotonously repeating itself
as far as he could see through the shadow,
appeared to offer him nothing worth his attention.
But presently he lurched forward, as if he had
made up his mind what to do. Shambling grotesquely,
but picking his way above the slime as
delicately as a cat, he kept on for perhaps a hundred
yards. Perhaps his nostrils had caught,
across the stagnant air, the tang of running water.
It was running water that he came to, for the
brook, though often foiled, often diverted, often
turned back upon itself, and almost lost, had succeeded
in saving for itself a clean channel through
the water-holes and chaos of the swamp.</p>
<p>Just at this point the brook ran through a
dark but living pool, brown but transparent, with
here and there a gleam of elusive light, as in the
eyes of some dark-eyed women. To this pool,
and others like it strung here and there through the
swamp, had gathered many fish,&mdash;trout, suckers,
and chub,&mdash;fleeing the too direct rays of the high
midsummer sun.</p>
<p>Lumbering down the sticky bank, the bear
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
squatted himself on his haunches close to the
edge of the water, and stared at it fixedly. After
a time his eyes began to discern the fish which
thronged in its deep centre. Having assured
himself that the fish were there, he lay down on
his stomach, in a hunched, shapeless position,
with his face close to the water and one paw uplifted.
It looked like a difficult position to hold,
but the bear held it, motionless as one of the
great roots, and quite as inert-looking, till by and
by some of the fish, which had been frightened
away by his coming, swam slowly back to the
weedy edges to feed. These fish were suckers,
weed-eaters, thick-bodied and sluggish in movement,
very different from the swift, ravening trout.
A spark flashed into the deep of the bear&rsquo;s eyes as
he saw them coming, but not so much as the
edge of a nostril quivered. A big sucker with
a snout that overhung, and opened and shut
greedily, came nosing the mud close up under
his face. With a lightning scoop the waiting paw
descended, and the fish, amid a noisy splashing,
was hurled out upon the bank, half stunned.
Before it could recover itself enough to flop, the
bear was upon it. Picking it up between his jaws,
he carried it lazily back to that dry couch he had
found beneath the tree of the hornets, there to be
eaten at his leisure.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">[24]</div>
<p>While the bear, ponderous and sullen, was
mumbling over his meal in that uncouth solitude,
there came, moving briskly down the brook&rsquo;s
margin, a gay little figure that seemed an embodied
protest against all the dark and enormous formlessness
of the swamp. It was as if the world of
sunlight, and swift motion, and bright vitality,
and completed form, had sent in its herald to
challenge the inertness of the gloom.</p>
<p>The tripping little figure was about the size of
a fox, and with the long, pointed, inquisitive
muzzle of a fox. Its abundant fur was of a
cloudy, irregular yellowish-gray, darkening at the
tips, and shading to almost black along the back.
Its tail was long, light, and vividly barred with
black. Its dainty, fine-clawed, hand-like feet
were bright black. But the most striking thing
about it was its face, which was very light gray,
with a large black patch around each eye like an
exaggerated pair of spectacles. The eyes themselves
were extraordinarily large, dark, and lustrous,
and glowed with a startling, almost impish
intelligence.</p>
<p>The raccoon was not given, as a rule, to daytime
prowlings, his preference being for moonlight
rather than sunlight. Nor, usually, was he
given to haunting the sinister recesses of Black
Swamp. But he was a wanderer, and capricious
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
as all vagabonds; and he had somehow discovered
that there were crawfish in the brook where it
flowed through the swamp. He was an ardent
fisherman, deft and unerring with his hand-like
claws. But to-day his fishing was unsuccessful,
for never a crawfish was so considerate as to come
his way. He saw the suckers and trout gathered
at the mid-deeps of the pools, but he was too impatient,
or not really hungry enough, to wait for
them to come near shore. While he was watching
beside the big pool wherein the bear had
recently fished with such success, a wood-mouse
unwarily came out of its hole, just at his feet, and
was captured before it had time to see its peril.
This prize contented the raccoon. Having killed
his victim instantly with a cheerful nip behind the
ears, he sat by the pool&rsquo;s edge and proceeded to
souse the morsel vigorously up and down in the
water before eating it. Not until it was washed
almost to a rag did he seem to think it clean
enough to eat, and then, after all his trouble, he
nibbled hardly the half of it, flinging the remnant
into the water with the air of a wasteful child who
has never known what it feels like to go hungry.</p>
<p>From the edge of the brook the raccoon ran up
the bank. After a pause he turned aimlessly into
the still turmoil of the trunks and roots. Every
fallen trunk, every long tentacle of a root that he
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
came to, he would mount it and run along it to
the end in whatever direction it led. As the luck
of the wild would have it, this erratic progress
brought him presently to one of the great buttressing
roots of the tree of the hornets. He
mounted it, of course, followed it nearly to the
base of the trunk, and stopped abruptly at the
sight of the bear.</p>
<p>The bear, who had but recently finished his
meal of fish, was lying half asleep on the dry
tamarack needles between the roots. He had
well eaten, but the sting in his mouth still fretted
him, and his mood was ugly. His great head
was moving sullenly, ponderously, from side to
side. Ominous and dark and ill-shapen, he
looked strangely like a portion of the swamp
come alive. The raccoon scrutinized him with
eyes of bright, mischievous disdain. The bear,
looking up, caught sight of him, and aimed a
treacherous blow at him with his tremendous,
armed forepaw. Light as a feather, the raccoon
avoided him. It was as if the very wind of the
blow had swept him from the place of danger.
The bear grunted at his failure, and fell to licking
his paw. The raccoon, who had slipped
around the tree, mounted another root, and gazed
at his rude assailant impishly. Then, glancing
upwards, his liquid eyes detected the pendent
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
gray globe of the hornets&rsquo; nest, pale in the
gloom.</p>
<p>The raccoon knew that inside every hornets&rsquo;
nest or wasps&rsquo; nest at this time of the year was a
mass of peculiarly succulent larv&aelig; and immature
insects. If this gray globe had been a wasps&rsquo;
nest, he might, perhaps, have attacked it at once,
his long hair, thick skin, and skill in protecting
his eyes, enabling him to brave, without too great
cost, the stings of the ordinary &ldquo;yellow-jacket.&rdquo;
But he noted well the formidable insects which
hummed about this nest; he knew the powers of
the black-and-white hornet. Having stared at
the nest for several minutes, he seemed to come
to some decision. Thereupon he tripped off
delicately over the tree-roots to the brook, to
resume his hunt for crawfish.</p>
<p>It was by this time getting far along in the
afternoon. As the gloom deepened at the approach
of twilight, the bear went to sleep. The
darkness fell thicker and thicker, till his breathing
bulk could no longer be distinguished from
the trunk beside it. Then, from narrow openings
in the far-off tree-tops, fell here and there a
ray of white moonlight, glassy clear, but delusive.
Under the touch of these scant rays, every
shrouded mystery of the swamp took on a sort
of malignant life.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">[28]</div>
<p>About this time the raccoon came back. In
that phantom illumination, more treacherous than
the dark, his wide eyes, nearly all pupil, saw as
clearly as in the daylight. They gleamed elvishly
as they took note of the sleeping bear. Then
they glanced upward toward the hornets&rsquo; nest,
where it hung just crossed by one chill white pencil
of a moon ray. Softly their owner ran up the
tree, his delicate claws almost inaudible as they
clutched the roughness of the bark.</p>
<p>At the base of the slim branch&mdash;hardly more
than a twig, but alive and tough&mdash;which held
the nest of the hornets, the raccoon stopped. He
wanted the contents of that nest. But he did
not want to test the prowess of its guardians,
which were now, as he well knew, all within, too
heavy with sleep to fly, but as competent as ever
to sting. After some moments of deliberation,
he bit the twig through and let the nest fall.
Then he scrambled hastily down the tree, as if
eager to see what would happen.</p>
<p>His purpose, perhaps, in dropping the nest
was simply a wanton impulse to destroy what
he desired but could not have. Perhaps he
thought the nest would roll into a shallow pool
at the other side of the tree, and so drown its
occupants, after which he might rifle it at his
own convenience. Or, possibly, he calculated that
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
that would happen which presently did. The
nest fell, not into the water, but between the
upcurled forepaws, and very close to the nose, of
the slumbering bear.</p>
<p>The bear, awakened and startled by its light
fall, growled and bit angrily at the intruding nest.
At the same time, with an instinctive clutch, he
ripped it open, not realizing just what it was.
The next instant he knew. With a <i>woof</i> of rage,
he tried to crush it and all its envenomed populace
within it. But he was too late. The great
hornets were already swarming over him, crawling,
burrowing deep into the fur about his face
and neck and belly. Furiously they plunged
and replunged their long, flame-like stings. His
eyes and muzzle crawled with the fiery torment.
Clawing, striking, snapping, grunting, whimpering,
he rolled over and over in desperate effort to
rid himself of the all-pervasive attack. But the
foes he crushed had already left behind their poison
in his veins. For a few moments his monstrous
contortions went on, while in a glassy patch of
white light, on the trunk above, clung the raccoon,
gazing down upon him with liquid, elvish eyes.
At length, quite beside himself with the torment, he
reared upon his hind-quarters, battling in the air.
Then he lunged forward, and went scrambling
headlong over the slippery black jumble of roots.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">[30]</div>
<p>The great beast&rsquo;s first impulse, one may guess,
was simply that of flight, of mad effort to escape
from foes whom he could not cope with. Having
no heed of his direction, the blind guidance
of trunk and root led him around in a
rough circle, till he came almost back to the tree
of his fate. Between him and the tree, however,
lay a spacious patch of morass, fairly firm on the
surface, but underneath, a slough of viscous mud.
His eyes almost closed by the stings, the bear
plunged straight forward into this morass. His
first instinct was to struggle frantically back, but
as he fell, his nose had dipped into the mud.
The chill of it was like a balm to his tortured
nostrils and lips. This, indeed, was what he
wanted. He wallowed straight ahead, plunging
his face deep into the icy slime. The drench of
it soothed the scorching of his stung belly. The
anguish of his eyelids was assuaged. Again and
again, buried now to his shoulders, he thrust his
face into the ooze. Then, with the salving of
his torment, his senses seemed to return. He
tried to wallow back to firm ground.</p>
<p>The swamp, as we have seen, was in all things
monstrous. It was monstrous now to its offspring
and victim, in warning him too late. The
patch of morass was of great depth, and the bear
was sucked under so swiftly that, even as he
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
turned to escape, he sank to the neck. His huge
forepaws beat and clawed at the stiffer surface,
breaking it down into the liquid ooze beneath.
Presently they also were engulfed. Only his
head remained above the mud. His gaping
muzzle, strained straight upward, emitted hideous
gasps and groans. A beam of moonlight lay
across the scene, still and malignant, and the
raccoon watched from the tree with an untriumphant
curiosity. When at last that terrible and
despairing head had vanished, and nothing
remained but a long convulsion of the mud, the
raccoon came daintily down from his post of observation,
and examined the remains of the hornets&rsquo;
nest. It was crushed and pounded quite too flat
to be of any further interest to him, so, after a
disdainful wrinkling of his fine black nose, he
tripped away to seek again the world to which
he belonged&mdash;the world of free airs, and dancing
leaves, and clamoring waters, and bright, swift,
various life, and yellow moonlight over the fields
of corn.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">[33]</div>
<h2 id="c3">THE ISLE OF BIRDS</h2>
<p>Far out of the track of ships, in the most
desolate stretch of the North Atlantic, walled
round with ceaseless thunder of the surf and wailed
about continually by innumerable sea-birds, the
islet thrust up its bleak rocks beneath a pale,
unfriendly sky.</p>
<p>It was almost all rock, this little island&mdash;gray
pinnacles of rock, ledges upon ledges of rock, and
one high, sunrise-facing cliff of rock, seamed with
transverse crevices and shelves. Only on the
gentler southward slope was the rock-frame of the
island a little hidden. Here had gathered a few
acres of mean, sandy soil, dotted sparsely with
tufts of harsh grass which struggled into greenness
at the bidding of a bitter and fog-blighted June.</p>
<p>But this remote, sterile isle, shunned even by
the whalers because of the treachery of its environing
reefs and tides, was by no means lifeless.
Indeed, it was thronged, packed, clamorous, screaming
with life. It was a very paradise of the nesting
sea-birds. Every meagre foot of it, rock and
sand, was preempted and occupied by the myriad
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
battalions of puffin, skua, auk, and saddle-back.
The incessant clamor of their voices, harsh and
shrill, overrode even the trampling of the surf.</p>
<p>Within the crowded little domain each tribe
had its territory. The puffins&mdash;or &ldquo;sea-parrots,&rdquo;
as some of the sailor folk call them, because of their
huge hooked beaks&mdash;occupied the sandy slope,
where they had their nests in deep burrows for protection
against the robber skuas and saddle-backs.
The auks had a corner of the cliff-face, where along
every ledge they sat straight up in prim, close array
like so many dwarf penguins, each couple occupied
with its precious solitary egg. The rest of the cliff-face
was monopolized by the screaming hosts of the
saddle-backs, those great, marauding, black-backed
gulls, whose yelps and wild <i>ka-ka-ka-kaings</i> made
most of the deafening tumult in which the rocks
were wrapt. As for the skuas, or &ldquo;men-o&rsquo;-war,&rdquo;
less numerous than the other inhabitants of the
island, they occupied the lower ledges and the
rock-crevices around the base of the puffins&rsquo; field.
These were the situations which they preferred.
If they had preferred the territory of the puffins
or the auks, or even of the big bullying saddle-backs
which were nearly twice their size, they
would have taken it. But they neither desired
nor knew how to dig burrows like the droll little
puffins; and they valued their precious eggs too
<span class="pb" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
highly to want to risk them on the narrow, exposed
shelves of the cliff-face, where there was no
room to make a proper nest. They took the
places they wanted, but as these were not the
places which the other tribes wanted, there was
no one to feel aggrieved. Saddle-back, auk, and
puffin&mdash;each tribe thought it had the pick of the
island territory, and felt altogether satisfied with
itself.</p>
<p>Now, the weakest of these tribes was the tribe
of the puffins. But one great strength they had,
which fully made up for their deficiency in size
and power. They knew how to burrow deep
holes for their nests, wherein their eggs and nestlings
were safe from the skuas and the saddle-backs.
Every available inch of soil on the island was
tunnelled with these burrows, like a rabbit-warren.
At the bottom of each burrow was either one big,
solitary egg, or a strange-looking youngster with
enormous head and beak and an insatiable appetite
for fish. At this season, late June, most of the
puffins had hatched out their eggs. At the doorway
of almost every burrow, therefore, was to be
seen one of the parents on guard, while the other
was away fishing to supply the insatiable demands
of the chick. In dense ranks, sitting erect like auks
or penguins, the seriously grotesque little birds
sentinelled their homes, maintaining a business-like
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
quiet in strange contrast to the ear-splitting
volubility of their neighbors.</p>
<p>At the extreme left of the territory of the
puffins, where the rocks broke abruptly, a tiny
cleft-full of earth made room for just one nest.
The pair of puffins who had their burrow here
were comparatively isolated, being some eight or
ten feet apart from the crowded ranks of their
kin. Their one big egg had been safely hatched.
The ridiculous chick, all gaping beak and naked
belly, the one object of their passionate solicitude,
was thriving and hungry according to the finest
traditions of infant puffinhood. The father, at
this moment, was on guard at the mouth of the
burrow, sitting solemnly erect on his webbed feet,
the backs of his legs, and his stiff, short tail;
while the mother was away fishing beyond the
white turmoil of the surf.</p>
<p>Surely the most curious figure of all the sea-birds
was his. For the body, it was not so far
out of the ordinary,&mdash;about the size of a big and
sturdy cockatoo,&mdash;white below and blackish-brown
above, sides of the face white, and a dingy white
collar on the neck; the webbed feet of a duck;
the stiff, short tail of a penguin; very short, strong
wings; and a round head. But the beak was like
a gaudy caricature. Curved from base to tip like
a parrot&rsquo;s, it was as long and high as the head
<span class="pb" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
which it seemed to overweigh, and adorned
apparently aimlessly with exaggerated horny ridges.
Over each eye was a little wart-like horn, and at
each corner of the beak, where it joined the skin
of the face, a vivid red, wrinkled excrescence, in
shape a sort of rosette, of skinny flesh. Serviceable,
to be sure, this beak was obviously, whether
for burrowing, fighting, or catching fish; but it
could be imagined as performing all these offices
equally well without its monstrous eccentricities
of adornment.</p>
<p>Everywhere in front of the cliff-face, over the
ledges, above the white shuddering of the surf,
and far out over the smooth leaden-gray rollers,
the air was full of whirling and beating wings.
These were the wings of the giant gulls and the
skuas. The puffins did no more flying than was
necessary&mdash;swift and straight from their nests
out to the fishing-grounds, and back with their
prey to the nests. Above their little domain,
therefore, the honeycombed south-sloping field,
there were no soaring or whirling wings, save for
three or four pirate skuas, on the watch for a
chance of robbery.</p>
<p>It was these marauders that the waiting puffin
by his nest door, on the outskirts of the colony,
had most dread of. He was a wise old bird, of
several seasons&rsquo; experience and many a successful
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
battle; and he knew that the light-darting skua,
though not much more than half the size of that
bully of the cliffs, the saddle-back, was much
more dangerous than the latter because so much
more courageous. An impatient croak from the
hungry nestling in the burrow made him poke
his big beak inside and utter a low, chuckling admonition.
When he withdrew his head and looked
up, he fluttered the feathers on his neck and
opened his beak angrily. A large skua, of a
rusty, mottled black all over, with long tail and
long, hawk-like wings, was circling above him,
staring down at him with savage eyes.</p>
<p>Just a moment or two before this the hen puffin,
fishing out at sea, had marked a plump herring
about a foot below the surface of a transparent,
glassy roller. Diving into the water with a violent
splash, she had pursued the fish in his own element,
swimming at an altogether miraculous speed. To
gain this speed she used not only her strong,
webbed feet, but also her short, sturdy wings.
Darting through the water in this fashion, just
below the surface, she was an amazing figure,
some fantastic link, as it were, between bird and
fish. The herring was overtaken, and clutched
securely in the vice of the great parrot beak.
Then, with much desperate flapping and splashing,
she burst forth and rose into the air, heading
<span class="pb" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
homeward, straight as a bullet, with her
prize.</p>
<p>Flying close to the surface of the sea, she passed
through the high-flung spray of the surf. At
this moment some premonition of her coming
drew her mate&rsquo;s eyes, and he caught sight of her,
just mounting above the ledges. Following his
look, the skua, whirling above his head, caught
sight of her also, and marked the prey she carried
in her beak. With one magnificent effortless
thrust of his long pinions, he swooped to intercept
her.</p>
<p>The puffin, her great beak and the prize it
clutched looking much too big for her swiftly
beating wings to upbear, was coming up over the
ledges at a humming pace, when she saw the dark
robber descending upon her. She swerved, and
so escaped the full force of the blow; but she
felt herself enveloped in a whirlwind of wings and
beaten down almost to the ground. At the same
time a long, straight, powerful beak, with the tip
hooked like a vulture&rsquo;s, snapped loudly at the
side of her head, grasping at the fish she carried.
Bewildered and terrified as she was, she was at
the same time full of fighting obstinacy. Hanging
doggedly to her prize, she recovered her
wing balance, and rocketed on toward her burrow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">[42]</div>
<p>Her mate, meanwhile, had seen the attack.
One grotesque little bob of indecision, then he
had launched himself down the slope to her succor.
He was not in time to interfere in the
first encounter, but as he came slanting down
like a well-aimed missile, the robber was just
about to swoop again. The indignant puffin
volleyed into him from the rear, turning him
almost end over end. For an instant his wings
flopped frantically, and he almost came down
upon the rocks. By the time he had recovered
himself his assailant had struck the water and was
swimming comfortably on a great gray swell beyond
the surf; while the female, with the herring
gripped still in her absurd beak, was just diving
triumphantly into her burrow to feed the ravenous
and complaining chick.</p>
<p>The skua was disgusted. Had he been what
he in some ways so much resembled, namely, a
goshawk or falcon, with a hawk&rsquo;s deadly talons,
the encounter would have had a very different result.
But his handsome black feet were armed with
nothing more formidable than webs for swimming.
His only weapons were his hook-tipped beak and
his long, powerful, buffeting wings. Backed, however,
by his pluck and his audacity, which were
worthy of a better occupation, these weapons were
usually sufficient, and he was not used to being
<span class="pb" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
balked as these two serious little householders
had balked him. With a vicious yelp, he went
swooping low along the sentinel ranks of the puffins,
followed by a snapping of indignant beaks which
crackled along the lines as he went&mdash;a curious, dry
sound, audible through the deep roar of the surf
and the high-pitched clamor of bird-cries. Here
and there a buffet of his wing, as it dipped suddenly,
would knock over one of the grotesque but
dauntless doorkeepers, who would pick himself up,
ruffle his feathers, and waddle back to his post with
outraged solemnity.</p>
<p>But revenge for his recent discomfiture was not
the only or the chief reason for this raid of the
pirate skua over the domain of the citizen puffins.
What he wanted above all was food&mdash;whether
fish, or eggs, or nestlings, it was all the same to
him. A fairly competent fisherman himself&mdash;though
not, of course, in the same class with the
puffins, because of their power of swimming under
water&mdash;he nevertheless preferred to make others
do his fishing for him, and to take toll of their honest
gains by force. A hardy and fearless highwayman,
there was satisfaction for him in the robbery
itself. As he flew thus close, and with the air of set
purpose, above the puffin burrows, a few desultory
saddle-backs who were circling just above dipped
lower to see what was going to happen. In case
<span class="pb" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
of a scrimmage of any sort, there was always the
possibility of a chance to snatch something.</p>
<p>As the skua skimmed along, just ahead of him
came a puffin, volleying upward from the sea with
a particularly fine fish in his beak. The lucky
fisherman shot straight to his hole. But, by the
finest hairbreadth, the robber got there before him.
There was a wild mix-up of wings. The puffin was
knocked clean over on his back, losing the fish,
which fell just before the next burrow. Like a
flash the proprietor of that next burrow bobbed
his head forward and snatched at the unexpected
windfall. He caught it by the tail, and turned to
plunge into the burrow with it. But in that same
instant the long beak of the skua caught it by the
head. For a second or so the two tugged savagely
at the prize, with a vast flapping and squawking.
Then the outraged owner, recovering himself,
floundered up, fixed his beak in the exposed
belly of the fish, and began to pull and jerk
like an angry terrier.</p>
<p>Feathers and sand flew into the air as the
triangular tug-of-war went on. But frantic as
was the turmoil of scuffling and flapping, the
near-by ranks of puffins paid no attention to it
whatever, except to turn their great beaks, all at
the same angle, and stare solemnly, like so many
fantastic maskers. The gulls overhead, however,
<span class="pb" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
gathered down with excited cries, seeking a chance
to take part in the scuffle.</p>
<p>But before they could get their greedy beaks
into it, it had come to an end. The fish was
torn apart. The puffin who had grabbed the tail
fell backwards with it, ruffled but triumphant,
into his burrow; the original owner was left with
just so much as his beak could hold&mdash;fortunately
no mean mouthful; while the too-successful marauder,
bearing by far the largest share of the
prize, beat vigorously aloft through the screaming
gulls, who would have tried to rob him had they
dared. Rising strongly above them, he headed
for the flat ledge, a little inland, where he and his
dusky mate had made their nest.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, on the neighboring cliff-face, had
just occurred one of those incidents which were
forever stirring up excitement among the colonies
of the auks and the saddle-backs. It began in
the usual way. Each pair of auks, it must be
remembered, has but one egg, which is laid, with
no pretence of a nest, on the bare narrow ledge.
As these eggs lie side by side along the rock, just
far enough apart for the parents to brood them,
and as they all look amazingly alike, sometimes
the owners themselves get mixed up as to the
identity of their speckled property. In this
instance, two mothers, on a crowded shelf some
<span class="pb" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
forty feet above the sea, claimed the same egg,
and both insisted on brooding it at the same
time. With curious, strident grumblings, deep
in their throats, they struggled over it. Their
mates, chancing both to return from their fishing
at this moment, joined vigorously in the discussion.
The egg was promptly rolled off the ledge
and smashed on the rocks below. But in the excitement
its absence was not noticed. Meanwhile
the combatants were making things most uncomfortable
for their nearest neighbors, so these
presently were dragged into the fight. The unfortunate
eggs began dropping over the ledge.
Instantly the great saddle-backs, from the noisy
colony higher up the cliff, swept down to gather
in the juicy harvest. They loved eggs, whether
fresh or half brooded. Screaming joyously, they
thronged the air just below the scene of the quarrel,
which still went on with zest. Some of the
tumbling eggs were stabbed cleverly and sucked
in mid-air as they fell, while others were devoured
or sucked up, according to the stage of development
of their contents, on the rocks below. So
long did the foolish auks continue their quarrel,
so unusual was the rain of eggs, so wild was the
screaming of the delighted banqueters below the
ledge, that presently a number of the brooding
saddle-backs&mdash;those who should have stayed by
<span class="pb" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
their charges to guard them, whatever their consorts
might be doing&mdash;were seduced from their
too tame responsibilities. Standing up in their
dizzy nests,&mdash;most of which held either two or
three muddy-colored eggs, scrawled with markings
of dull maroon,&mdash;they stretched their fierce
yellow beaks over the brink and peered down with
predacious eyes. For many of them the temptation
was not to be resisted. With hoarse cries
they launched themselves downward, and joined
deliriously in the scramble.</p>
<p>About level with the crest of the cliff, some
half dozen of the dusky skuas were sailing
leisurely. They saw their chance. There was
nothing in the world more to their taste than
eggs&mdash;and particularly the big, rich eggs of the
great saddle-back gulls. Down they swooped
upon the unguarded nests; and in a moment,
plunging their long beaks through the shells,
they were feasting greedily. All around them
sat the other gulls, by the hundred&mdash;faithful ones
who had resisted temptation and stuck to their
nests. These screamed angrily, but made no attempt
to interfere. &ldquo;Let each look out for his
own&rdquo; was frankly their policy. Before any of
the delinquent brooders came back, the skuas had
cleared out every unguarded nest, and sailed off
with derisive cries.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">[48]</div>
<p>And so it came about that an unwonted number
of saddle-backs, freed from domestic ties until
they should be ready to lay new clutches of eggs,
but very savage and vindictive for all their release,
now came flapping inland over the island on the
lookout for any possible chance to avenge themselves.</p>
<p>At this moment the great skua who had robbed
the puffin of its fish came in sight of his nest.
At his approach the female, who had grown impatient,
arose from her handsome, greenish-brown,
mottled eggs, sprang into the air, and
sailed off toward the sea. For just about ten
or a dozen seconds the precious eggs were left
exposed, while the male swept down to them
on a long, swift glide. But in those brief seconds
fate struck. With an exultant yelp a huge
saddle-back dropped out of the sky, directly
upon the nest, and plunged his beak into one of
the eggs. The egg was not far from hatching.
He dragged forth the naked chick and swallowed
it ravenously. Before he could turn to
another egg, the skua had fallen upon him,
hurling him clear of the nest, and tearing at
him with desperate beak.</p>
<p>Now, the great gull, fully two feet and a
half in length from the tip of his punishing
yellow beak to the tip of his tail, was not far
<span class="pb" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
from twice the size of his fearless and furious
assailant. Moreover, having just had his own
nest destroyed, he was in a fighting mood. Ordinarily,
being a thorough bully, he would have
cowered and fled before the skua&rsquo;s swift rage,
but now he turned and struck back savagely.
More nimble than he, the skua evaded the blow,
and caught him by the neck. And promptly
the two became entangled into a flapping, tearing
jumble of beaks and feathers.</p>
<p>It was close beside the nest that the struggle
went on; but meanwhile the two remaining eggs
were lying uncovered to the eyes of prowlers.
They did not lie there long. Two more big
saddle-backs straightway pounced upon them,
crushing them flat in the scuffle. Engrossed
though he was, the skua saw them. He was
only a shameless robber, but his mettle was of a
temper of the finest, and he knew not fear.
Tearing himself free from his heavy foe, he
pounced frantically upon these new assailants of
his home. Startled, they hesitated whether to
fight or flee. Then, seeing the odds so far in
their favor, they turned to fight. The first
saddle-back joining them, they presently succeeded
in pulling the skua down. Then against
their great weight and overpowering wings, his
courage availed him little. Smothered, beaten,
<span class="pb" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
trodden upon, he disappeared from sight beneath
the yelping turmoil. The odds had been too
great for him. In half a minute the battle was
over and his dark body, with the throat completely
torn out, lay unresisting beneath the
broad, pink, heavy-webbed feet of his conquerors.</p>
<p>Suddenly, as if at a signal, all three saddle-backs
lifted their heads and stared about them.
They marked their victim&rsquo;s mate winging upward
toward them from the sea, swiftly, as if a prescience
of evil had summoned her. They saw
two other skuas sailing down from the cliff-top,
as if to demand their business in skua territory.
They had no stomach to face that demand; they
had no heart for a fight on anything approaching
fair terms. Flapping heavily into the air, they
flew off in haste to lose themselves in the myriads
of their screaming fellows. The female skua,
returning, hovered low; but she did not alight.
In silence, her head thrust downwards, she circled
and circled endlessly on dark wings above the
scattered ruins of her nest, the bedraggled and
tattered body of her slain mate. And the stiff
ranks of the puffins, like fantastic toy birds
carved in wood and painted, stared down upon
her solemnly from the slopes near by.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">[51]</div>
<h2 id="c4">THE ANTLERS OF THE CARIBOU</h2>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">When the frost is on the barrens,</p>
<p class="t0">And the popple-leaves are thinned,</p>
<p class="t0">And the caribou are drifting</p>
<p class="t0">Down the wind,&mdash;&mdash;</p>
</div>
<p>So writes one who knows all about how autumn
comes to the Tobique barrens, and who
claims to know as much as most men about the
caribou. But the caribou do not always drift, by
any means. They are rather an incalculable folk,
these caribou,&mdash;and even in their name one
notes their inclination to be contrary; for the
herds which frequent the high, watery barrens of
northern New Brunswick are not, as one might
suppose, the &ldquo;caribou of the barren grounds,&rdquo;
but the larger and warier &ldquo;woodland caribou.&rdquo;
The faithful observer of the manners and customs
of this tribe may spend much time one year in
learning what he will be constrained to unlearn
with humility the next.</p>
<p>The lonely lake, smooth as a mirror between
its flat, desolate shores, spread pink, amber, and
gold toward the cloudless pink and orange sky,
where the sun had just sunk below the wooded
<span class="pb" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
horizon. All the way up the lake, on one side,
the shore was an unbroken stretch of treeless barren.
On the other side the low, dark, serried
ranks of the fir forest advanced almost to the
water&rsquo;s edge, their tops like embattled spear-points
against the colored sky. From this
shore a spit of sand jutted straight out into the
lake. On its extremity, his magnificent bulk and
lofty head black against the pellucid orange glow,
stood a giant bull-moose, motionless as if modelled
in bronze. His huge muzzle was thrust
straight out before him, as if he was about to roar
a challenge. His wide, palmated antlers were
laid back over his shoulders.</p>
<p>Far down the lake a solitary huntsman lay beside
a dying camp-fire, and gazed at the splendid
silhouette. A faint puff of the aromatic wood-smoke,
breathing across his nostrils at that
moment, bit the picture into his memory so
ineffaceably, that never after could he sniff the
smell of wood-smoke on evening air without the
desolate splendor of that spacious and shining
scene leaping into his brain. But he was a
hunter, and the great bull was his quarry.
Where he lay he was invisible against the dark
background of tree and brush. Presently he
reached for his rifle and for a trumpet-like roll of
birch bark which lay close by. Noiselessly as a
<span class="pb" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
snake he crawled to the shelter of a thicket of
young firs. Then he arose to his feet and slipped
into the forest.</p>
<p>At the same instant the moose, as if some
warning of his unseen foe had been flashed into
his consciousness, turned and strode off, without
a sound, into the woods.</p>
<p>Soon the tiny camp-fire had died to a few white
ashes, and the half-dark of a cloudless night had
fallen&mdash;still, and chill, and faintly sweet with
damp, tonic scents of spruce, bayberry, and
bracken. There was that in the air which spoke
of frost before morning. It wanted nearly an
hour of moonrise. The wide, vague world of the
night, that seemed so empty, so unstirring, grew
populous with unseen, furtive life&mdash;life hunting
and hunted; loving, fearing, trembling; enjoying
or avenging. But there was no sound, except
now and then the inexplicable rustle of a dead
leaf, or an elvish gurgle of water from somewhere
in the shadows along shore.</p>
<p>At last the hunter, threading his way through
the forest as noiselessly as the craftiest of the
prowling kindreds, arrived in the heart of a
covert of young fir-trees, from beneath whose
sweeping branches he could command a near and
clear view of the sand-spit. Disappointed he was,
but not surprised, to find that the great moose-bull
<span class="pb" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
had disappeared. Seating himself with his
back to a small tree, his rifle and the birch-bark
trumpet, or &ldquo;moose call,&rdquo; across his knees, he
settled down to wait&mdash;to wait with that exhaustless
patience, that alert yet immobile vigilance,
which are, perhaps, hardest to acquire of all
the essentials of woodcraft. In the stillness the
wood-mice came out and resumed their play, with
fairy-thin squeaks and almost inaudible patterings
and rustlings over the dry carpet of the fir needles.</p>
<p>At last, above the flat, black horizon beyond
the lower end of the lake, came the first pale
glow of moonrise. At sight of it the hunter
lifted the birch-bark horn to his lips and breathed
through it a deep, bleating call, grotesque and
wild, yet carrying an indescribable appeal, as if
it were the voice of all the longing of the wilderness.
Twice he sounded the uncouth call. Then
he waited, listening, thrilled with exquisite expectancy.</p>
<p>He knew that, when one called a moose, one
never knew what might come. It might, of
course, be the expected bull, his lofty, antlered
head thrusting out over the dark screen of the
bushes, while his burning eyes stared about in
search of the mate to whose longing call he had
hastened. In that case he might perhaps feel
vaguely that he had been deceived, and fall back
<span class="pb" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
soundlessly into the darkness; or, taking it into
his head that another bull had forestalled him, he
might burst out into the open, shaking his antlers,
thrashing the bushes, and roaring savage challenge.
But, on the other hand, it might not be a bull at
all that would come to the lying summons. It
might be an ungainly moose-cow, mad with jealousy
and frantically resolved to trample her rival
beneath her knife-edged hoofs. Or it might be
something dangerously different. It might be a
bear, a powerful old male, who had learned to
spring upon a cow-moose and break her neck
with one stroke of his armed paw. In such a
contingency there was apt to be excitement; for
when a bear undertakes to stalk a cow-moose, he
gives no notice of his intentions. The first warning,
then, of his approach, would be his final savage
rush upon the utterer of the lying call. For
such a contingency the hunter held his rifle always
ready.</p>
<p>But, on the other hand, there might well be
nothing at all&mdash;no answer, all through the long,
cold, moon-silvered night, summon the birch horn
never so craftily.</p>
<p>And this was what the hunter thought had
been so far the result of his calling. Had he
chanced to look over his shoulder, he might have
known better. He might have seen the shadows
<span class="pb" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
take substance, condensing into a gigantic and
solid bulk just behind the little tree against
which he leaned his back. He might have seen
the spread of vast and shadowy antlers, the long,
sullen head, and drooping muzzle, the little eyes,
in which, as they detected him in his ambush, a
sudden flame of rage was quenched by the timely
wisdom of fear. But the giant shape dissolved
back into shadow, and the hunter never knew
that he himself had been stalked and considered.</p>
<p>After a long silence, the birch-bark horn again
sent forth its appeal. Loud and long it called;
then it murmured a series of caressingly desirous
notes, impatient and importunate. When it
stopped, from the thick dark just below the sand-spit
came a light snapping of twigs and brushing
of branches, which seemed to be moving toward
the open point. The hunter was puzzled; for a
moose-bull, coming in answer to the call, would
either come with a defiant rush, and make a much
louder noise, or he would come secretively and
make no noise whatever. With pounding pulses
he leaned forward to see what would emerge upon
the sand-spit.</p>
<p>To his surprise, it was no moose, but a small
gray caribou cow, looking almost white in the
level rays of the now half-risen moon. She was
followed by another cow, larger and darker than
<span class="pb" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
the first, and then by a fine caribou bull. Softly,
alluringly, the hunter sounded his call again, but
not one of the caribou paid any attention to it
whatever. To the bull of the caribou it mattered
not what lovelorn cow-moose should voice her
hoarse appeals to the moon. He and his followers
were on their own affairs intent.</p>
<p>He was a noble specimen of his kind, as to
stature, with a very light grayish head, neck, and
shoulders, showing white in contrast to the dull
brown of the rest of his coat. But his antlers,
though large, were unevenly developed, so obviously
imperfect that the hunter, who wanted
heads, not hides or meat, hesitated to shoot. He
chose rather to bide his time, and hope for a
more perfect specimen, the law of New Brunswick
allowing him only one.</p>
<p>For several minutes the bull stood staring across
the lake, as though half minded to swim it, and
his two cows&mdash;antlered like himself, though much
less imposingly&mdash;watched him with dutiful attention.
Whatever his purpose, however, it was
never declared; for suddenly there came a new
and more impetuous crashing among the undergrowth,
and the eyes of the little herd turned to
see what was approaching. An instant later a
second bull, about the size of the first, but very
much darker in coloring, broke furiously through
<span class="pb" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
the bushes. He rushed about half-way down the
sand-spit, then stopped, snorting and blowing
defiance.</p>
<p>The new-comer had a magnificent set of antlers,
but the hunter forgot to shoot.</p>
<p>The white bull, surprised by the unexpected
challenge, stood for an instant staring stupidly,
waving his great ears. Then all at once the hot
blood of arrogant possession and jealous mastery
seemed to rush to his head. Thrusting aside
the two cows, who stood huddled in his path,
with a furious booing grunt, he lurched forward
to meet the challenger.</p>
<p>With lowered heads, noses between their knees,
and the branching spikes of their antlers presented
straight to the front, they came together with a
shock and a snort. The hard horn clashed with
the dry resonance of seasoned wood. Being of
about equal size, both withstood the shock.
Both staggered; but, recovering themselves instantly,
they stood pushing with all the strength
of their straining, heaving bodies, their hoofs
digging deep into the sand.</p>
<p>Then, on a sudden, as if the same idea had at
the same instant flashed into both their seething
brains, they disengaged and jumped backward,
like wary fencers.</p>
<p>For several tense seconds they stood eying
<span class="pb" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
each other, antlers down, while the big-eyed
cows, with ears slowly waving, looked on placidly,
and the moon, now full risen, flooded the whole
scene with lavish radiance. The only concern of
the cows was that the best bull should win, with
proved mastery compelling their allegiance.</p>
<p>Suddenly the new-comer, the dark bull, as if
to get around his adversary&rsquo;s guard, feinted to
the right, and then lunged straight forward. But
the white bull was too experienced to be caught
by such a well-worn ruse. He met the attack
fairly. Again the antlers clashed. Again those
monstrous pantings and savage gruntings arose on
the stillness, as the matched antagonists heaved
and pushed, their hind legs straddled awkwardly
and their hoofs ploughing the sand.</p>
<p>At length the white bull put one of his hind
feet in a hole. Giving way for a second, he was
forced backwards almost to the water&rsquo;s edge.
With a furious effort, however, he recovered himself,
and even, by some special good fortune or
momentary slackness of his adversary, regained
his lost ground. Both paused for breath. The
fight hung exactly in the balance.</p>
<p>To judge from his antlers, the white bull was
the older, and therefore, one may suppose, the
craftier duellist. It occurred to him now, perhaps,
that against a foe so nearly his equal in
<span class="pb" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
strength he must seek some advantage in strategy.
He made a sudden movement to disengage his
antlers and jump aside. To the trained eyes of
the hunter, watching from the thicket, the intention
was obvious. But it failed curiously. At
the very instant of the effort to disengage, the
dark bull had surged forward with violence. Not
meeting the resistance expected, he was taken by
surprise and stumbled to his knees. The white
bull, quick to feel his advantage, instantly changed
his purpose and surged forward with all his force.
For a moment the dark bull seemed to crumple up
as his rival&rsquo;s heaving shoulders towered above him.</p>
<p>Now, this was the white bull&rsquo;s chance. It was
for him to roll his enemy over, disengage, rip the
dark bull&rsquo;s unfortunate flank, and tread him down
into the sand. But he did nothing of the sort.
He himself staggered forward with the fall of his
adversary. Then he drew back again, but slowly.
With the motion his adversary regained his feet.
Once more the two stood, armed front to front,
grunting, straining, sweating, heaving, but neither
giving ground an inch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Locked!&rdquo; said the hunter, under his breath.</p>
<p>That, indeed, was the fact. The two pairs
of antlers were interlaced. But the sinister truth
was not yet realized by the combatants themselves,
because, when either tried to back free, so as to
<span class="pb" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
renew the attack more advantageously, it seemed
to him quite natural that the other should furiously
follow him up. In the confused struggle
that now followed, they more than once pivoted
completely around; and the two cows, perceiving
something unusual in the combat, drew off with
a disapproving air to the extremity of the sand-spit.
Little by little the white bull appeared to
be getting a shade the better of the duel; for at
length, regaining his first position, he began forcing
his rival steadily, though slowly, back toward
the woods. Then all at once, during a pause for
breath, both at the same moment awoke to knowledge
of the plight they had got themselves into.
Both had sought to back away at the same instant.
In the next they were tugging frantically
to break apart.</p>
<p>But struggle as they might their efforts were
utterly in vain. The tough, strong horn of their
new antlers was ever so slightly elastic. It had
yielded, under the impact of their last charge, just
far enough for a perfect locking. But in the
opposite direction there was no yielding. They
were inextricably and inexorably fixed together,
and in a horrid attitude, in which it was impossible
to feed, or even to straighten up their bowed necks.</p>
<p>In the agonized pulling match which now
began, the white bull had the best of it. He had
<span class="pb" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
slightly the advantage in weight. Little by little
he dragged his grunting rival out along the sand-spit,
till the two cows, almost crowded off, bounced
past with indignant snorts and vanished down the
shore. A moment more, and he had backed off
the sand into a couple of feet of water.</p>
<p>The shock of the plunge seemed to startle the
white bull into new rage. He laid the blame of
it upon his foe. As if with all his strength renewed,
he recovered himself, and thrust the dark
bull backward with such tempestuous force that
the latter had all he could do to keep his footing.
Presently he felt himself at the edge of the woods,
his hind feet in a tangle of bushes instead of on
the sand. Then, exhausted and cowed, his legs
gave way, and he sank back upon his haunches.
Frantic with despair, he struggled to butt and
strike with his fettered prongs, and in this futile
struggle he fell over on his side. The white bull,
his paroxysm of new vigor come suddenly to an
end, was dragged down with him, and the two lay
with heaving flanks, panting noisily.</p>
<p>The hunter had laid down his roll of birch
bark. He was just about to step forth from his
ambush and mercifully end the matter with his
knife. But there came a brusque intervention.
He had not been the only spectator of the
strange combat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">[65]</div>
<p>Out from the thickets at the lower edge of the
point came plunging an enormous black bear.
With one huge paw uplifted, he fell upon the
exhausted duellists. One blow smashed the neck
of the white bull. Turning to the other, who
glared up at him with rolling, hopeless eyes, he
fell to biting at him with slow, luxurious cruelty.</p>
<p>In that instant the hunter&rsquo;s rifle blazed from
the thicket. The bear, shot through the spine
with an explosive bullet, dropped in a sprawling
heap across the bent forelegs of his victim. Stepping
forth into the moonlight, the hunter drew
his knife with precision across the throat of the
wounded bull.</p>
<p>Straightening himself up, he stared for a few
moments at the three great lifeless carcasses on
the sand. Then he let his glance sweep out
over the glassy waters and level, desolate shores.
How strange was the sudden silence, the still
white peace of the moonlight, after all that madness
and tumult and rage which had just been so
abruptly stilled! A curious revulsion of feeling
all at once blotted out his triumph, and there
came over him a sense of repugnance to the bulk
of so much death. Stepping around it, he sat
down with his back to it all, on a stranded log,
and proceeded to fill his pipe.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">[67]</div>
<h2 id="c5">THE SENTRY OF THE SEDGE-FLATS</h2>
<p>Pale, shimmering green, and soaked in sun,
the miles of sedge-flats lay outspread from
the edges of the slow bright water to the foot
of the far, dark-wooded, purple hills. Winding
through the quiet green levels came a tranquil
little stream. Where its sleepy current joined
the great parent river, a narrow tongue of bare
sand jutted out into the golden-glowing water.
At the extreme tip of the sand-spit towered, sentry-like,
a long-legged gray-blue bird, as motionless
as if he had been transplanted thither from
the panel of a Japanese screen.</p>
<p>The flat narrow head of the great heron, with
its long, javelin-like, yellow beak and two slender
black crest-feathers, was drawn far back by a curious
undulation of the immensely long neck, till it
rested between the humped blue wing-shoulders.
From the lower part of the neck hung a fine
fringe of vaporous rusty-gray plumes, which lightly
veiled the chestnut-colored breast. The bird
might have seemed asleep, like the drowsy expanses
of green sedge, silver-blue water, and opalescent
turquoise sky, but for its eyes. Those eyes,
<span class="pb" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
round, unwinking, of a hard, glassy gold with
intense black pupils, were unmistakably and savagely
wide awake.</p>
<p>Over the tops of the sedges, fluttering and
zigzagging waywardly, came a big butterfly, its
gorgeous red-brown wings pencilled with strange
hieroglyphs in black and purple. It danced out
a little way over the water; and then, as if suddenly
terrified by the shining peril beneath, came
wavering back toward shore. A stone&rsquo;s throw
up the channel of the little stream lay a patch of
vivid green, the leaves of the arrow-weed, with its
delicate, pallid blooms dreaming in the still air
above them. The butterfly saw these blossoms,
or perhaps smelt them, and fluttered in their
direction to see if those pure chalices held honey.
But on his way he noted the moveless figure of
the heron, conspicuous above the ranks of the
sedge. Perhaps he took the curious shape for a
post or a stump. In any case, it seemed to offer
an alluring place of rest, where he might pause
for a moment and flaunt his glowing wings in the
sun before dancing onward to the honey-blossoms.
He flickered nearer. To him those unwinking
jewels of eyes had no menace. He hovered an
instant about two feet above them. In that
instant, like a flash of light, the long, pale neck
and straight yellow beak shot out; and the butterfly
<span class="pb" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
was caught neatly. Twisting his head shoreward,
without shifting his feet, the heron struck
the glowing velvet wings of the insect sharply on
the sand. Then, having swallowed the morsel
leisurely, he drew his head down again between
his shoulders, and resumed his moveless waiting.</p>
<p>The next matter of interest to come within the
vision of those inscrutable eyes was a dragon-fly
chase. Hurtling low over the sedge-tops, and
flashing in the sunlight like a lace-pin of rubies,
came a small rose-colored dragon-fly, fleeing for
its life before a monster of its species which blazed
in emerald and amethyst. The chase could have
but one ending, for the giant had the speed as
well as the voracious hunger. The glistening
films of his wings rustled crisply as he overtook
the shining fugitive and caught its slender body
in his jaws. The silver wings of the victim vibrated
wildly. The chase came to a hovering
pause just before that immobile shape on the
point of the sand-spit. Again the long yellow
beak darted forth. And the radiant flies, captive
and captor together, disappeared.</p>
<p>But such flimsy fare as even the biggest of
butterflies and dragon-flies was not contenting to
the sharp appetite of the heron. He took one
stiff-legged stride forward, and stood in about six
inches of water. Here he settled himself in a
<span class="pb" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
somewhat altered position, his back more awkwardly
hunched, his head held lower, and his dagger
of a bill pointing downward. His wicked
golden eyes were not indifferent to the possibilities
of the air above him, but they were now concerning
themselves more particularly with the water
which flowed about his feet.</p>
<p>If any one stands at the brink of a quiet summer
stream, and keeps still enough, and watches
intently enough, however deserted the landscape
may appear, he will see life in many furtive forms
go by. The great blue heron kept still enough.
The water at this point went softly over a shoal
half sand, half mud, and in the faint movement
of the clear amber-brown current the sunlight
wove a shimmering network on the bottom.
Across this darted a shadow. The heron&rsquo;s beak
shot downward with an almost inaudible splash,
transfixing the shadow, and emerged with a glittering
green and silver perch, perhaps five inches
in length. The quivering body of the fish had
its knife-edged gills wide open, and every spine
of its formidable, armed fins threateningly erect.
But the triumphant fisherman strode ashore with
it and proceeded to hammer it into unconsciousness
on the hard sand. Then he swallowed it
head first, thus effectually disarming every weapon
of fin and gill-cover. The progress of this substantial
<span class="pb" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
mouthful could be traced clearly down the
bird&rsquo;s slim length of gullet, accompanied as it was
by several seconds of contortions so violent that
they made the round yellow eyes wink gravely.
As soon as the morsel was fairly down the bird
stretched its neck to its full length, with a curious
hitch of the base as if to assure himself the process
was completed. Then he resumed his post
of watching. He had no more than taken his
place than a huge black tadpole wriggled by over
the gold-meshed bottom. It was speared and
swallowed in an eye-wink. Soft, slippery, and
spineless, it made but a moment&rsquo;s incident.</p>
<p>A little after, on the smooth surface of the
smaller stream, some fifty feet up-channel, a tiny
ripple appeared. Swiftly it drew near. It was
pointed, and with a long fine curve of oily ripple
trailing back from it on either side, like the outline
of a comet&rsquo;s tail. As it approached, in the
apex of the parabola could be seen a minute black
nose, with two bright, dark little eyes just behind
it. It was a small water-rat, voyaging adventurously
out from its narrow inland haunts among
the lilies.</p>
<p>The great heron eyed its approach. To the
swimmer, no doubt, the blue-gray, immobile
shape at the extremity of the sand-spit looked like
some weather-beaten post, placed there by man
<span class="pb" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
for his inexplicable convenience in regard to
hitching boats. But presently, something strange
in the shape of the post seemed to strike the little
voyager&rsquo;s attention. He stopped. Perhaps he
saw the menacing glitter of that yellow, unwinking
stare. After a moment of wavering irresolution,
he changed his course, swam straight across
channel, scrambled out upon the wet mud of the
farther shore, and vanished among the pale root-stalks
of the sedge. The heron was savage with
disappointment; but no slightest movement betrayed
his anger, save that the pinkish film of the
lower lid blinked up once, as it were with a snap,
over each implacable eye. His time would come&mdash;which
faith is that which supports all those
who know how to wait. He peered upstream
for the coming of another and less wary water-rat.</p>
<p>Instead of the expected ripple, however, he
now caught sight of a shadow which flickered
across the surface of the water and in an instant
had vanished over the pale sea of the grass-tops.
He looked up. In the blue above hung poised,
his journeying flight just at that moment arrested,
a wide-winged duck-hawk, boldest marauder of
the air. The heron threw his head far back, till
his beak pointed straight skyward. At the same
time he half lifted his strong wings, poising himself
to deliver a thrust with all the strength that
<span class="pb" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
was in him. On the instant the hawk dropped
like a wedge of steel out of the sky, his rigid,
half-closed pinions hissing with the speed of his
descent. The heron never flinched. But within
ten feet of him the hawk, having no mind to impale
himself on that waiting spear-point, opened
his wings, swerved upward, and went past with a
harsh hum of wing-feathers. Wheeling again,
almost instantly, he swooped back to the attack,
buffeting the air just above the heron&rsquo;s head, but
taking care not to come within range of the
deadly beak. The heron refused to be drawn
from his position of effective defence, and made
no movement except to keep the point of his
lance ever toward the foe. And presently the
hawk, seeing the futility of his assaults, winged
off sullenly to hunt for some unwary duck or
gosling.</p>
<p>As he went the heron stretched himself to his
full gaunt height and stared after him in triumph.
Then, turning his head slowly, he scanned the
whole expanse of windless grass and sunlit water.
One sight fixed his attention. Far up the windings
of the lesser stream he marked a man in a
boat. The man was not rowing, but sitting in
the stern and propelling the boat noiselessly with
an Indian paddle. From time to time he halted
and examined the shore minutely. Once in a
<span class="pb" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
while, after such an examination, he would get
out, kneel down, and be occupied for several minutes
among the weeds of the shallows along the
stream&rsquo;s edge. He was looking at the musquash
holes in the bank, and setting traps before those
which showed signs of present occupancy. The
heron watched the process, unstirring as a dead
stump, till he thought the man was coming too
near. Then, spreading a vast, dark pair of wings,
he rose indignantly and flapped heavily away up
river, trailing his length of black legs just over
the sedge-tops.</p>
<p>Not far above the mouth of the stream the
man set the last of his musquash traps. Then
he paddled back leisurely by the way he had
come, his dingy yellow straw hat appearing to
sail close over the grass as the boat followed the
windings of the stream. When the yellow hat
had at length been swallowed up in the violet
haze along the base of the uplands, the great blue
heron reappeared, winging low along the river
shore. Arriving at the sand-spit he dropped his
feet to the shallow water, closed his wings, and
settled abruptly into a rigid pose of watching,
with his neck outstretched and his head held high
in the air.</p>
<p>The most searching scrutiny revealed nothing
in all the tranquil summer landscape to disturb
<span class="pb" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
him. Nevertheless, he seemed to have lost conceit
of his sentry post on the tip of the sand-spit.
Instead of settling down to watch for what might
come to him, he decided to go and look for what
he wanted. With long, ungainly, precise, but absolutely
noiseless strides, he took his slow way up
along the shore of the little river, walking on the
narrow margin of mud between the grass-roots
and the water. As he went his long neck undulated
sinuously at each stride, his head was held
low, and his eyes glared under every drooping
leaf. The river margin, both in the water and
out of it, was populous with insect life and the
darting bill took toll of it at every step. But the
most important game was frogs. There were
plenty of them, small, greenish ochre fellows,
who sat on the lily leaves and stared with foolish
goggle-eyes till that stalking blue doom was almost
upon them. Then they would dive head-foremost
into the water, quick almost as the fleeting
of a shadow. But quicker still was the stroke
of the yellow beak&mdash;and the captive, pounded
into limpness, would vanish down his captor&rsquo;s insatiable
throat. This was better hunting than he
had had upon the sand-spit, and he followed it
up with great satisfaction. He even had the triumph
of capturing a small water-rat, which had
darted out of the grass-roots just as he came by.
<span class="pb" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
The little beast was tenacious of life, and had to
be well hammered on the mud before it would
consent to lie still enough to be swallowed comfortably.
This pleasant task, however, was presently
accomplished; and the great bird, as he
stretched his head upward to give his neck that
final hitch which drove the big mouthful home,
took a careless step backward into the shallow
water. There was a small sinister sound, and
something closed relentlessly on his leg. He
had stepped into a steel trap.</p>
<p>Stung by the sharp pain, astounded by the
strangeness of the attack, and panic-stricken, as
all wild creatures are by the sudden forfeit of their
freedom, the great bird lost all his dignified self-possession.
First he nearly broke his beak with
mad jabs at the inexplicable horror that had
clutched him. Then, with a hoarse squawk of
terror, he went quite wild. His huge wings flapped
frantically, beating down the sedges and the blossoms
of the arrow-weed, as he struggled to wrench
himself free. He did succeed in lifting the trap
above water; but it was securely anchored, and
after a minute or two of insane, convulsive effort,
it dragged him down again. Again and again he
lifted it; again and yet again it dragged him
down inexorably. And so the blind battle went
on, with splashing of water and heavy buffeting
<span class="pb" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
of wings, till at last the bird fell back utterly
beaten. In the last bout the trap had turned and
got itself wedged in a slanting position, so that it
was impossible for the captive to hold himself upright.
He lay sprawling on his thighs, one wing
outspread over the mud and leaves, the other on
the water. His deadly beak was half open, from
exhaustion. Only his indomitable eyes, still
round, gold-and-black, glittering like gems,
showed no sign of his weakness or his fear.</p>
<p>For a long time he lay there motionless, half
numbed by the sense of defeat and by that gnawing
anguish in his leg. Unheeded, the gleaming
dragon-flies hurtled and darted, flashed and poised
quivering, just above his head. Unheeded, the
yellow butterflies, and the pale blue butterflies,
alighted near him on the blooms of the arrow-weed.
A big green bull-frog swam up and
clambered out upon the mud close before him&mdash;to
catch sight at once of that bright, terrible eye
and fall back into the water almost paralyzed
with fright; but still he made no movement.
His world had fallen about him, and there was
nothing for him to do but wait and see what
would happen next&mdash;what shape his doom
would take.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, down along the margin mud, still
hidden from view by a bend of the stream, another
<span class="pb" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
stealthy hunter was approaching. The big
brown mink, who lived far upstream in a muskrat
hole whose occupants he had cornered and
devoured, was out on one of his foraging expeditions.
Nothing in the shape of flesh, fish, or
insect came amiss to him; but having ever the
blood-lust in his ferocious veins, so that he loved
to slaughter even when his appetite was well sated,
he preferred, of course, big game&mdash;something
that could struggle, and suffer, and give him the
sense of killing. A nesting duck or plover, for
example, or a family of musquash&mdash;that was
something worth while. On this day he had
caught nothing but insects and a few dull frogs.
He was savage for red blood.</p>
<p>Very short in the legs, but extraordinarily long
in the body, lithe, snake-like in his swift darting
movements, every inch of him a bundle of tough
elastic muscles, with a sharp triangular head and
incredibly malevolent eyes, the mink was a figure to
be dreaded by creatures many times his size. As
he came round the bend of the stream, and saw the
great blue bird lying at the water&rsquo;s edge with wings
outstretched, the picture of helplessness, his eyes
glowed suddenly like live coals blown upon. He
ran forward without an instant&rsquo;s hesitation, and
made as if to spring straight at the captive&rsquo;s
throat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">[81]</div>
<p>This move, however, was but a feint; for the
big mink, though his knowledge of herons was
by no means complete, knew nevertheless that
the heron&rsquo;s beak was a weapon to beware of. He
swerved suddenly, sprang lightly to one side, and
tried to close in from the rear. But he didn&rsquo;t
know the flexibility of the heron&rsquo;s neck. The
lightning rapidity of his attack almost carried it
through; but not quite. He was met by a
darting stroke of the great yellow beak, which
hurled him backward and ploughed a deep red
furrow across his shoulder. Before he could recover
himself the bird&rsquo;s neck was coiled again like
a set spring, the javelin beak poised for another
blow.</p>
<p>Most of the wild creatures would have been
discouraged by such a reception, and slunk away
to look for easier hunting. But not so the mink.
His fighting blood now well up, for him it was a
battle to the death. But for all his rage he did
not lose his cunning. Making as if to run away,
he doubled upon himself with incredible swiftness
and flew at his adversary&rsquo;s neck. Quick as he
was, however, he could not be so quick as that
miracle of speed, which the eye can scarcely follow,
the heron&rsquo;s thrust. The blow caught him
this time on the flank, but slantingly, leaving a
terrible gash, and at the same time a lucky buffet
<span class="pb" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
from the elbow of one great wing dashed him into
the water. With this success the heron strove to
rise to his feet&mdash;a position from which he could
have fought to greater advantage. But the lay
of the trap pulled him down again irresistibly.
As he sank back the mink clambered out upon
the shore and crouched straight in front of him,
just a little beyond the reach of his stroke.</p>
<p>The mink was now a picture of battle fury,
every muscle quivering, blood pulsing from his
gashes, his white teeth showing in a soundless
snarl, his eyes seeming to throb with crimson
fire. The heron, on the other hand, seemed
absolutely composed. His head, immobile, alert,
in perfect readiness, was drawn back between his
shoulders. His eyes were as wide, and fixed,
and clear, and glassily staring, as the jewelled
eyes of an idol.</p>
<p>For some seconds the mink crouched, as if
trying to stare his adversary out of countenance.
Then he launched himself straight at the bird&rsquo;s
back. The movement had all the impetuosity
of a genuine attack, but with marvellous control
it was checked on the instant. It had been
enough, however, to draw the heron&rsquo;s counterstroke,
which fell just short of its object. With
the bird&rsquo;s recovery the mink shot in to close
quarters. He received a second blow, which laid
<span class="pb" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
open the side of his face, but it was a short
stroke, with not enough force behind it to repulse
him. Ignoring it, he closed, fixed his teeth in
the bird&rsquo;s neck, and flung his lithe length over
the back, where it would be out of reach of the
buffeting wings.</p>
<p>The battle was over; for the mink&rsquo;s teeth
were long and strong. They cut deep, straight
into the life; and, undisturbed by the windy
flopping of the great, helpless wings, the victor
lay drinking the life-blood which he craved. A
black whirling shadow sailed over the scene,
but it passed a little behind the mink&rsquo;s tail and
was not noticed. It paused, seeming to hover
over a patch of lily leaves. A moment more,
and it vanished. There was a hiss; and the
great duck-hawk, the same one whom the heron
had driven off earlier in the day, dropped out of
the zenith. The mink had just time to raise his
snarling and dripping muzzle in angry surprise
when the hawk&rsquo;s talons closed upon him. One
set fastened upon his throat, cutting straight
through windpipe and jugular; the other set
gripped and pierced his tender loins. The next
moment he was jerked from the body of his
prey, and carried&mdash;head, legs, and tail limply
hanging&mdash;away far over the green wastes of the
sedge to the great hawk&rsquo;s eyrie, in the heart
<span class="pb" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
of the cedar-swamp beyond the purple uplands.</p>
<p>Some ten minutes later a splendid butterfly, all
glowing orange and maroon, came and settled on
the back of the dead heron, and waved its radiant
wings in the tranquil light.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">[85]</div>
<h2 id="c6">A TREE-TOP AERONAUT</h2>
<p>Although in the open clearings it was
full noon&mdash;the noon of early September,
hot and blue and golden&mdash;here in the
lofty aisles of the forest it was all cold twilight.
Such light as glimmered down through the thick-leaved
tree-tops was of a mellow shadowy brown
and a translucent green, changing from the one
tone to the other mysteriously as the eye shifted
its backgrounds. One tall trunk, long ago
shattered and broken off just below the crown
by a stroke of lightning, stood pointing bleakly
toward a round opening in the leafy roof, reaching
upward a thin-foliaged, half-dead, gnarled
and twisted arm.</p>
<p>In the outer shell and coarse strong bark of
the stricken tree life lingered tenaciously, but
its heart was fallen to decay. Near the base
of the arm a round hole gave entrance, through
the shell of live wood, to a chamber in the hollow
heart. The chamber had yet another entrance,
beneath a knot, higher up on the opposite side
of the trunk. Through these two holes filtered
a dim warm light, just strong enough to show a
<span class="pb" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
huddle of small, ruddy-brown, furry shapes sleeping
snugly at the bottom of the chamber.</p>
<p>The forest was as still and soundless as a
dream, under the spell of the noonday heat.
But presently the silence was broken by the
approach of heavy footsteps, now crackling as
they crunched the dry twigs, now muffled and
dull as they sank into beds of deep moss. They
were plainly human footsteps, for no other creature
but man would move so crudely and heedlessly
through the forest quiet. Every one of
the wild kindred, from the bear down to the
wood-mouse, would move with a furtive wariness,
desiring always to see without being seen, either
intent upon some hunting or solicitous to avoid
some hunter.</p>
<p>Down a shadowy corridor of soaring trunks
came into view two figures&mdash;a tall heavy-shouldered
lumberman, carrying an axe, and a
slim boy with a light rifle in his hand. It was
the lumberman, booted and long-striding, who
made all the noise. The boy, in moccasins,
stepped lightly as an Indian, his eager blue eyes
searching every nook and stump and branch as
he went, hoping at every step to surprise some
secret of the furtive wood-folk.</p>
<p>Near the foot of the blasted tree he stopped,
looking up.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">[89]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder what lives in that hole up there,
Jabe?&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>The lumberman peered upward critically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jiminy, ef that ain&rsquo;t a likely-lookin&rsquo; squir&rsquo;l
tree!&rdquo; he answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Squirrel tree!&rdquo; echoed the boy. &ldquo;As if
every tree wasn&rsquo;t a squirrel tree, wherever there&rsquo;s
a squirrel &rsquo;round!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye, but there&rsquo;s squir&rsquo;ls an&rsquo; squir&rsquo;ls! You&rsquo;ll
see!&rdquo; retorted the woodsman; and, swinging
his axe, he brought the back of it down upon
the trunk in three or four sounding strokes.</p>
<p>Straightway a dark little shape, appearing in
the hole beneath the branch, launched itself
into the air. It looked like a leap of desperation,
as there was no tree within reach of
any ordinary quadruped&rsquo;s leap. Yet the daring
little shape was plainly that of a quadruped, not
of a bird. It was followed instantly, in lightning
succession, by six or seven others equally daring;
and all went sailing away, in different directions,
across the mysteriously shadowed air. They
sailed on long downward slants, with legs spread
wide apart and connected on each side by furry
membrane, so that they looked like some kind
of grotesque, oblong toy umbrellas broken loose
in a breeze. The boy stared after them with
an exclamation of wonder and delight, trying to
<span class="pb" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
keep his eye on them all at once; but in a moment
they had disappeared, gaining the shelter
of other trees, and effacing themselves from view
as if by enchantment.</p>
<p>All but one. As the flying squirrels came
aeroplaning from their rudely assaulted citadel,
the woodsman had dropped his axe, snatched
up a bit of stick about a foot long, and hurled
it after one of the gliding figures. Your woodsman
is an unerring shot with the hurled axe,
the pike-pole, or the billet of wood; but up
there, in the deceitful transparency of shadow
and glimmer, the little aeronaut was sailing with
an elusive speed. The whirling missile almost
missed its mark. It just caught the outspread
furry tail, which was serving as a rudder and
balancer to that adventurous flight. The tail,
tough and flexible, gave way and took no injury.
But the tiny aeroplanist, his balance rudely destroyed,
plunged headlong to the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh-h-h!&rdquo; exclaimed the boy, with long-drawn
commiseration. But, his curiosity too
strong for his pity, he raced forward with
the woodsman to capture and examine their
prize.</p>
<p>There was no prize to be found. Both had
seen the flier come to earth. Both had marked,
with expert eyes, the exact point of his fall. But
<span class="pb" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
there was nothing to be seen but a softly disappearing
dent in the cushion of moss.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll be&mdash;jiggered!&rdquo; said the woodsman,
fingering his stubbled chin and scrutinizing
the nearest tree-trunks with narrowed eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Serves us right!&rdquo; said the boy. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad
he&rsquo;s got away. I thought you&rsquo;d killed him,
Jabe!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reckon I just <i>blowed</i> him over,&rdquo; responded
the woodsman. &ldquo;But now ye know where they
hang out, ye kin ketch one alive in a cage-trap, if
ye want to git to know somethin&rsquo; of his manners
an&rsquo; customs&mdash;eh, what? When ye&rsquo;ve <i>killed</i> one
of these wild critters, after all, to my mind he
ain&rsquo;t no more interestin&rsquo; than a lady&rsquo;s fur boa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the two man creatures disappeared down the
confusing vistas of the forest, the soft dark eyes
of the flying-squirrel, disproportionately large and
prominent, with a vagueness of depth which made
them seem all pupil, stared after them mildly from
the refuge of a high crotched branch. Unhurt,
even unbewildered by his dizzy plunge, he had
bounced aside with a motion too swift for his
enemies&rsquo; eyes to follow, and placed a tree-trunk
between himself and peril. Darting up the trunk
like a fleeting brown streak, he had been safely
hidden before his enemies reached the tree.</p>
<p>In his high retreat, the flying-squirrel did not
<span class="pb" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
crouch as a red squirrel would have done, but lay
stretched and spread out as if flattened by violence
upon the bark. His color, of an obscure warm
brown, faintly smudged with a darker tone, blended
so perfectly with the hue of the bark that, if the
eye once looked away, it could with difficulty
detect him again. A member of a little-known
branch of the flying-squirrel family,&mdash;the flying-squirrel
of Eastern Canada,&mdash;he was nearly a foot
in length, some two inches longer than the common
flying-squirrel, from whom he differed also
very sharply in color, his retiring brown and
gray being in marked contrast to the buff and
drab and pure white of his lesser but more famous
cousin. Buff and white would have been so conspicuous
a livery in the brown Canadian forests
that his ancestors would never have survived to
produce him had they not managed to change that
livery in time to baffle their foes.</p>
<p>The flying-squirrel, unlike the impudent and
irrepressible red squirrel, had a great capacity for
patience, as well as for prudence. Moreover, he
had no great liking for activity as long as the sun
was up, his enormous eyes adapting him for the
dim life of the night. For some minutes after the
sound of footsteps had died away in the distance,
he lay unstirring on his branch, his ears alert to
the tiniest forest whisper, his nostrils quivering as
<span class="pb" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
they interrogated every subtlest forest scent. All
at once his wide eyes grew even wider, and a sort
of spasm of apprehension flitted across their liquid
depths. What was that faint, dry, rustling sound&mdash;the
mere ghost of a whisper&mdash;on the bark of
the trunk behind him? Nervously he turned his
head. There was nothing in sight, but the ghostly
sound continued, so slight, so thin, that even his
fine ear could hardly be sure of its reality.</p>
<p>The little watcher remained moveless as a
knot on the bark. The creeping whisper softly
mounted the tree. Then at last a flat, brownish-black,
vicious head came into view around the
trunk, and arrested itself, swaying softly, just over
the base of the branch. It was the head of a
large black snake.</p>
<p>The snake&rsquo;s eyes, dull yet deadly, met those
of the squirrel and held them. For a moment
the black head was rigid. Then it began to
sway again, with a slow hypnotizing motion.
The eyes&mdash;shallow, opaque, venomous&mdash;seemed
to draw closer together as they concentrated their
energy upon the mildly glowing orbs of their intended
victim. At last the waving head began to
draw near, the black body undulating stealthily
into view behind it. Nearer, nearer it came, the
flat hard eyes never shifting, till it seemed that
one lightning lunge would have enabled it to fix
<span class="pb" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
its fangs in the fascinated victim&rsquo;s neck. But at
this moment the little aeronaut whisked half
round, flirted his broad fluff of a tail straight out
behind him, and sailed quietly from his perch on
a long gradual swoop, which brought him back
to the base of the tree from which he had originally
started. The hypnotizing experiment of the
black snake had been, in this instance, an unqualified
failure. Angry and disappointed, the snake
withdrew to hunt mice or other easier game. The
flying-squirrel ran cheerfully up the tree, slipped
back into the hole, and curled himself up complacently
to sleep away the rest of the daylight.
Of his companions, two had already stealthily returned,
and the others crept in soon afterwards
quite unruffled.</p>
<p>That night moonrise came to the forest close
on the vanishing trail of the sunset. A long white
ray, flooding in through the tree-tops, lit up the
hole beneath the branch of the blasted trunk.
Without haste the flying-squirrels came one after
another to their high doorway and launched themselves
upon the still air. One might have thought
that their first purpose would have been to forage
for a meal; but, instead of that, they seemed like
children just let out of school, bent on nothing so
much as relieving their pent-up spirits. Probably
they were not hungry. It was the season of
<span class="pb" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
abundance, and they had, perhaps, ample store of
green nuts and tender young pine-cones within
their hollow tree. In any case, they knew the
forest was full of good provender for them, the
forest-floor covered with berries for when they
should choose to descend and gather them.
There was no hurry. It was good to amuse
themselves in their high and dim-lit world.</p>
<p>Their favorite game seemed to be to criss-cross
each other, as it were, in their long gliding
flights, which, beginning near the top of one tree
would end generally near the foot of another, as
far away as the impetus of their start and their
descent would allow. Thence they would dart
nimbly to the top again, sometimes with a
restrained <i>chirr</i> of mirth, to repeat the gay adventure.
Sometimes, when their descent was
steep, they would rise again toward the end of it,
by altering, probably, the angle of their membranes
or side-planes. As they flashed spectrally
past each other, touched suddenly by some white
finger of moonlight, their play was like an aerial
game of tag. But they never actually &ldquo;tagged&rdquo;
each other. Most likely they took good care to
avoid any approach to contact in mid flight, which
might have meant a fall to the dangerous forest-floor,
the haunt of prowling foxes, skunks, and
weasels.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">[96]</div>
<p>But though their chief dread seemed to be of
the far dark ground and its perils, there were
perils, too, for the little aeronauts even in their
leafy heights. In the midst of their leaping,
gliding, and sailing, there came a hollow cry across
the tree-tops. It was a melancholy sound but
full of menace&mdash;a <i>whoo-hoo-hoo-oo-oo</i>&mdash;repeated
at long, uncertain, nerve-racking intervals. It
sounded remote enough from the hollow tree, but
at its first note the game of the furry aeroplanists
came to a stop. One would have said that there
were no such things as flying-squirrels in the
Quah-Davic woods.</p>
<p>After some fifteen or twenty minutes of
sepulchral summons and answer, the calling of
the owls ceased. In perhaps fifteen minutes
more, the flying-squirrels seemed to make up
their minds that the danger had removed to some
other part of the forest. Then, at first timorously,
but soon with all their former merriment and zest,
the tree-top aeronauts resumed their game.</p>
<p>The game was at its height. Down a long
aisle of the forest the high moon poured a flood
of unobstructed light. Athwart this lane of brilliance
the flying-squirrels went passing and repassing.
On a sudden, as one of them was sailing gayly
across, it was as if a fragment of black cloud fell
upon him noiselessly out of the whiteness, blotting
<span class="pb" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
him out. Somewhere in the cloud burned two
terrible round eyes, and beneath it reached forth
two sets of rending talons. The life of the gay
little glider was clutched out of him with a
strangled scream, and the cloudy shape, its eyes
blazing coldly, drifted away into the shadows
with its prey.</p>
<p>The game came to a full stop&mdash;for that night
at the least. As luck would have it, the squirrel
who had been through the adventures of the
morning&mdash;the encounter with Jabe Smith&rsquo;s
missile and the interview with that would-be
mesmerizer, the black snake&mdash;had been sailing
just below his unhappy playmate at the moment
of the great wood-owl&rsquo;s swoop. He had seen the
whole tragedy, and it made him distrustful of
aeroplaning for the moment. He decided to
emulate his cousin the red squirrel, and trust to
running and climbing, to the solid trunks and
branches, rather than to the treacheries of the air.
After hiding in a crotch till his palpitations had
somewhat calmed down, he descended the tree in
a cautious search for food. He had had his fill
of nuts and cones; he wanted juicier fare. He
went on all the way down to earth, his appetite
set on the ripening partridge-berries.</p>
<p>Now, as it chanced, the boy had taken to heart
that suggestion of the lumberman&rsquo;s in regard to the
<span class="pb" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
cage-trap. His appetite for knowledge of all the
wild creatures of the woods was insatiable. He was
eager to know the flying-squirrels more intimately
than he could know them from the plates and text
of his natural history books. His idea was to catch
one, keep it a while, win its confidence, study it,
and then give it back its freedom before it had
time to forget how to take care of itself among
the perils of freedom. That very afternoon,
therefore, he had returned to the &ldquo;squirr&rsquo;l tree,&rdquo;
carrying a spacious trap-cage of strong wire&mdash;a
cage of two chambers, in which he had already
kept with success both red squirrels and ground
squirrels. The second or inner chamber was the
regulation revolving wire cylinder, designed to
give the little captive such strenuous exercise as it
might crave, and to divert its thoughts from its
captivity. The door was a wide trap, opening
upwards and outwards, and shutting with a powerful
spring at the least touch upon the trigger
within. Beyond the trigger the boy had fixed a
varied bait, cunningly calculated to the vagaries
of the squirrel appetite. There were sweet nut-kernels
securely tied down, a fragrant piece of
apple, a bit of green corn-ear, and a crisp morsel
of bacon rind.</p>
<p>The boy had no means of knowing whether
the flying-squirrel was like his red cousin or not
<span class="pb" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
in the matter of a taste for meat. But he felt
sure that some one or another of these scented
dainties would prove too much for the prudence
of anything that called itself a squirrel. Near the
great trunk of the blasted tree he found another
giant, half fallen, its top still upheld by the
embrace of its stout-armed neighbors. The
long gradual incline he rightly judged to be a
favorite pathway of the flying-squirrels as they
raced upwards from their excursions to the forest
floor. So, upon the slope of the trunk, some
six or seven feet above the earth, he fixed his
trap securely, and left it to show what it could
do.</p>
<p>For a long time, however, it did nothing. It
was a new strange thing on the familiar path, and
all the little people of the wild avoided it. Till
near the first gray of dawn not a flying-squirrel
had dared approach its neighborhood.</p>
<p>The forest powers seem to have sometimes a
mischievous trick of selecting some particular one
of their children for special trial, of following up
that one for days with a kind of persecution. So
it came about that the same adventurous little
aeronant who had fallen foul of both Jabe Smith
and the black snake, and had so narrowly escaped
the pounce of the brown owl, had the misfortune
to be sighted, as he was feasting on the partridge-berries
<span class="pb" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
not far from the sloping tree, by a weasel
which had had bad luck in his night&rsquo;s hunting.</p>
<p>Sinuous as a snake and swifter, his cruel eyes
glowing like points of live flame, the long yellow
form of the weasel darted forward. With a faint
squeak of terror the squirrel sprang for the sloping
trunk, his own hope being to get high enough
to launch himself into the air. But the flying-squirrel
is less nimble on his feet than the red or
the gray. He was much slower than the weasel.
He gained the sloping trunk, indeed, but the foe
was almost at his heels. It looked as if the doom
of the wild was upon him. By a frantic effort,
however, he evaded for a second the weasel&rsquo;s rush.
Desperately he raced up the well-known trail. He
came to the cage. There was no time to go over
it or to go around it. He hurled himself straight
in and brought up with a shock against the wires
of the partition. At the same instant there was
a loud click behind him. The door snapped
down tight. And the weasel, unable to check
himself, bumped his nose against the wires with a
violence that brought the blood and stirred his
hunting lust to a madness of fury.</p>
<p>Both pursuer and pursued recovered themselves
in a second. It was well that the boy, an exact,
methodical soul, had lashed the cage securely to
the trunk, otherwise the mad assaults of the weasel
<span class="pb" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
would have torn it loose and dashed it to the
ground. He was all over it and around it every
moment, flinging himself viciously this way and
that in the effort to catch his quarry against the
wires. And the quaking squirrel at the same
time dashed himself frantically from side to side,
keeping ever as much space as possible between
himself and those relentless blood-seeking jaws.
He had not the wit or the coolness to crouch in
the centre of the cage, where he might securely
have chattered derision at his foe. He had not
yet, perhaps, even arrived at the truth that his
prison was his citadel, his tower of safety. But
at length, as luck would have it, in one of his
desperate bounds, he shot himself clean through
the round opening into the second chamber, and,
before he knew it, he was racing at a breathless
pace in the vain effort to climb the wall of the
spinning cylinder.</p>
<p>For a moment or two the weasel was nonplussed.
He stopped short and stared at these
amazing tactics of his victim, his thin lips wrinkled
back from his pointed jaw and muzzle in a sort
of soundless snarl. Then, apparently coming to
the conclusion that such a farce had gone on long
enough, he sprang with all his strength upon the
top of the cylinder, in the direction in which it
was spinning. It was a great mistake. The
<span class="pb" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
cylinder did not stop. It spun on and shot him
off indignantly, head-first, into space, and brought
him with a stupefying thud upon the roots of the
nearest tree. Very sore and disconcerted, he
picked himself up, gave one look at the spinning
mystery, and slunk off behind the tree, in a
humbleness of spirit such as few of his irrepressible
tribe have ever known.</p>
<p>All but paralyzed by exhaustion and by the
utter extremity of his fear, the flying-squirrel
stopped racing with his wheel. With all four
hand-like paws, and even with his teeth, he clung
to the wires, till presently his weight brought it
to a standstill. Then he crept through the exit
and crouched, trembling and panting, on the floor
of the outer chamber. Here, soon after sun-up,
the boy, who was an early riser, found him. He
was puzzled, was the boy, over that smear of
blood on the cage door; but, finding no clew to
the events of the night, he was obliged to lay the
matter away among the many insoluble enigmas
wherewith the ancient wood so continually and so
mockingly provokes the invader of its intimacies.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">[103]</div>
<h2 id="c7">THE THEFT</h2>
<p>From their cave in the cleft of Red Rock,
where the half-uprooted pine-trees swung
out across the ravine, the two panthers came
padding noiselessly down the steep trail. In
the abrupt descent their massive shoulders and
haunches worked conspicuously under the tawny
and supple hide, in a loose-jointed way that belied
their enormous strength. Where the trail came
out upon a patch of grassy level, starred with
blossoms, beside the tumbling mountain stream,
they parted company&mdash;the female turning off
across the tangled and rocky slopes, while the
male went on down to hunt in the heavy timber
of the valley-bottom. Game was scarce that spring,
and the hunt kept them both busy. They had
no misgivings about leaving their two blind
sprawling cubs to doze on their bed of dry grass
in the dark inner corner of the cave. They knew
very well that in all their range, for a radius of
forty or fifty miles about the humped and massive
hog-back of Red Rock, there was no beast so
bold as to trespass on the panther&rsquo;s lair.</p>
<p>It was, perhaps, a half hour later that a man
<span class="pb" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
came in sight, a half-breed squatter, moving
stealthily up the farther bank of the stream.
His dark figure appeared and disappeared, slipping
from rock to tree, from tree to wild-vine
thicket, as he picked his way furtively along the
steep and obstructed slope. Not a twig cracked
under his moccasined steps, so carefully did he
go, though the soft roar of the stream would have
covered any such light sound from all ears but
the initiated and discriminating ones of the forest
kindreds. His small watchful eyes took note of
the grassy level on the other side of the stream,
and, with a sure leap to a rock in mid channel, he
came across. He arrived just a few feet below
the spot where the female panther had taken her
departure, digging in her broad pads heavily in
the take-off of her leap. The grasses, trodden
down in the heavy footprints, were still slowly
lifting their heads. At sight of this trail, so
startlingly fresh, the man crouched instantly back
into the fringing bush, half lifting his rifle, and
peering with vigilant eyes into the heart of every
covert. He expected to see the beast&rsquo;s eyes palely
glaring at him from some near ambush.</p>
<p>In a few minutes, however, he satisfied himself
that the panther had gone on. Emerging from
the bushes, he knelt down and examined the footprints
minutely. Yes, the trail was older than
<span class="pb" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
he had at first imagined, by a good half hour.
Some of the trodden grass had perfectly recovered
itself, and a crushed brown beetle was already surrounded
by ants. He arose with a grim smile,
and traced the trail back across the grass-patch
till it mingled with the confusion of footprints,
going and coming, which led up the mountains.
In this confusion he overlooked the traces of the
other panther, so he was led to the conclusion
that only one of the pair had gone out. If this
was the path to the lair, as he inferred both from
the number of the tracks and the fitness of the
country, then he must expect to find one of the
pair at home. His crafty and deep-set eyes
flamed at the thought, for he was a great hunter
and a dead shot with his heavy Winchester.</p>
<p>For days the half-breed had been searching for
the trail and the den of the panther pair. His
object was the cubs, who, as he knew, would be
still tiny and manageable at this season. A good
panther skin was well worth the effort of the chase,
but a man in the settlements, who was collecting
wild animals for a circus, had offered him one
hundred and fifty dollars for a pair of healthy
cubs. The half-breed&rsquo;s idea was to get the cubs
as young as possible, and bring them up by bottle
in his cabin till they should be big enough for
delivery to the collector.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">[108]</div>
<p>Before starting up the steep and difficult trail,
the man examined his rifle. A panther at home,
protecting her young, was not a foe with whom
he could take risks. She commanded the tribute
of his utmost precaution.</p>
<p>A careful survey of the slope before him convinced
his practised eye that the den must be
somewhere in that high cleft, where the broken
faces of the red sandstone glowed brightly through
dark patches and veils of clinging firs. He
marked the great half-fallen pine-tree, with its
top swung out from the rock face, and its branches
curling upward. Somewhere not far from that,
he concluded, would he come upon the object of
his search.</p>
<p>Difficult as was the ascending trail, now slippery
with wet moss, now obstructed with thick
low branches which offered no obstacle to the
panthers, but were seriously baffling to the man,
he climbed swiftly and noiselessly. His lithe feet,
in their flexible moose-hide moccasins, took firm
hold of the irregularities of the trail, and he glided
over or under the opposing branches with as little
rustling as a black snake might have made. Every
few moments he stiffened himself to the rigidity
of a stump, and listened like a startled doe as he
interrogated every rock and tree within reach of
his eyes. Ready to match his trained senses
<span class="pb" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
against those of any of the wilderness kin, he felt
confident of seeing or hearing any creature by
which he might be seen or heard. Mounting
thus warily, in some twenty minutes or thereabouts
he came out upon a narrow shelf of rock
beneath the downward swing of the old pine-tree.</p>
<p>Cautiously he peered about him, looking for
some indication of the cave. This, as he told
himself, was just the place for it. It could not
be very far away. Then suddenly he shut himself
down upon his heels, as if with a snap, and
thrust upward the muzzle of his Winchester.
Lifting his eyes, he had seen the black entrance
of the cave almost on a level with the top of his
head. A little chill ran down his spine as he
realized that for those few seconds his scalp had
perhaps been at the mercy of the occupant.</p>
<p>Why had the beast not struck?</p>
<p>The man took off his old cap, stuck it on the
muzzle of his gun, and, raising it cautiously,
wagged it from side to side. This move eliciting
no demonstration from within the cave, he
scratched noisily on the rock. Having repeated
this challenge several times without response, he
felt sure that both panthers must be away from
home.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, he was not going to let himself
be over-confident. He was too sagacious and
<span class="pb" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
instructed a woodsman to think that the wild
creatures would always act the same way under
the same circumstances. It was not impossible
that the occupant of the cave was just waiting to
see. Drawing back some six or eight feet, the
man wriggled slantingly up the slope of rock,
with the muzzle of his Winchester just ahead of
him, till his face came level with the entrance.
Every muscle of his body was strung taut for an
instantaneous recoil, in case he should see before
him two palely flaming eyes, afloat, as it were,
upon the darkness of the interior.</p>
<p>But no; at first he could see nothing but the
darkness itself. Then, as his eyes adapted themselves
to the gloom, he made out the inmost recesses
of the cave, and realized that, except for a
vague little heap in one corner, the cave was
empty. In that case, there was not a single moment
to be lost. With one piercing backward
glance down the trail, he slipped into the cave,
snatched up the two kittens, regardless of their
savage spitting and clawing, and thrust them into
an empty potato-sack which he had brought with
him for the purpose. Hurriedly twisting a cord
about the neck of the sack, he wiped his bleeding
hands upon his sleeve with a grin, slung the sack
over his left shoulder, and hurried away. Having
captured the prize, he was quite willing to
<span class="pb" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
avoid, if possible, any immediate reckoning with
the old panthers.</p>
<p>Till he reached the grass-patch by the stream
he took no pains to go silently, but made all possible
haste, crashing through the branches and
sending a shower of small stones clattering down
the ravine. The angry and indomitable kittens
in the bag on his back kept growling and spitting,
and trying to dig their sharp claws into him, but
his buckskin shirt was tough, and he paid no attention
to their protest. At the edge of the torrent,
however, he adopted new tactics. Leaping
to the rock in mid channel, he crossed, and then,
with great difficulty, clambered along close by the
water&rsquo;s edge, well within the splash and the spray.
When he had made a couple of hundred yards in
this way, he came to a small tributary brook, up
which he waded for some eighty or a hundred
feet. Then, leaving the brook, he crept stealthily
up the bank, through the underbrush, and so
back to the valley he had just left, at a point some
little distance farther downstream. Thence he
ran straight on down the valley at a long easy
trot, keeping always, as far as possible, under
cover, and swerving from time to time this way
or that in order to avoid treading on dry underbrush.
His progress, however, was quite audible,
for at this point in the venture he was sacrificing
<span class="pb" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
secrecy to speed. He had fifteen or sixteen miles
to go, his cabin being on the farther slope of the
great spur called Broken Ridge, and he knew that
he could not feel absolutely sure as to the outcome
of the enterprise until he should have the
little captives secure within his cabin.</p>
<p>As he threaded his way through the heavy
timber of the valley bottom, a good six or seven
miles from the den in Red Rock, he began to
feel more at ease. Here among the great trunks
there was less undergrowth to obscure his view,
less danger of the panthers being able to steal up
upon him and take him unawares. He slackened
his pace somewhat, drawing deep breaths into his
leathern lungs. But he relaxed no precaution,
running noiselessly now over the soft carpet of
the forest, and flitting from tree-trunk to tree-trunk
as if an enemy were at his very heels. At
last, quitting the valley, he started on a long
diagonal up the near slope of Broken Ridge
Spur.</p>
<p>The face of the country now suddenly changed.
Years before, a forest-fire had traversed this slope
of the ridge, cutting a clean swathe straight along
it.</p>
<p>The man&rsquo;s ascending trail thus led him across
a space of open, a space of undergrowth hardly
knee-deep, dotted with a few tall &ldquo;rampikes,&rdquo; or
<span class="pb" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
fire-stripped tree-trunks, bleached by the rains and
inexpressibly desolate. Haying here no cover,
the man ran his best, and finally, having crossed
the open, he dropped down in a dense thicket to
rest, breathing hard from that last spurt.</p>
<p>In the secure concealment of the thicket he
laid aside the complaining burden from his back,
stood his rifle in a bush, let out his belt a couple
of holes, and stooped to stretch himself on the
moss for a quick rest. As he did so, he cast a
prudent eye along his back trail. Instantly he
stiffened, snatched up his gun again, sank on one
knee, and insinuated the muzzle carefully between
the screening branches. A huge panther had just
shown himself, rising into view for an instant, and
at once sinking back into the leafage.</p>
<p>At this disappearance the man grew uneasy.
Was the beast still trailing him, belly to earth,
through the low undergrowth? Or had it swerved
aside to try and get ahead of him, to ambuscade
him by and by from some rock or low-hung branch.
Or, on the other hand, had it given up the pursuit
rather than face the perils of the open? The
man was annoyed at the uncertainty. Raising himself
to his full height in order to command a better
view of the trail, but at the same time keeping
well hidden, he stood hesitating, doubtful whether
to hurry on as fast as possible or to wait a while in
<span class="pb" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
this safe ambush in the hope of getting a shot at
his pursuer.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>Back to the cleft in Red Rock, beneath the
down-swung pine, came the female panther. She
had been lucky. She had made a quick kill, and
satisfied her hunger, and now she was hurrying
back to nurse her cubs.</p>
<p>Just before the door of the cave she caught the
scent of the man. The fur arose angrily along her
neck and backbone, and she entered in anxious
haste. Instantly she came out again, whining and
glancing this way and that as if bewildered. Then
she plunged in again, sniffed at the place where the
kittens had lain, sniffed at the spots where the
man&rsquo;s feet had stepped, and darted out once more
upon the ledge. But her appearance was very
different now. Her eyes blazed, her long and
powerful tail lashed furiously, and her fangs were
bared to the gums in anguished rage. Lifting her
head high, she gave vent to a long scream of summons,
piercing and strident. The cry reached her
mate, and brought him leaping in hot haste from
his ambush beside a spring pool where he was
waiting for the appearance of some thirsty deer.
But it did not reach the ears of the running man,
who was at that moment threading a dense coppice
far down the valley. Having sent out her call
<span class="pb" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
across the wide silence, she waited for no response,
but darted down the trail. The tracks of the despoiler
were plain to follow, and her nose told her
that they were a good half hour old. She followed
them down to the water&rsquo;s edge, out on to the rock
and across the torrent. Then she lost them.</p>
<p>When her mate arrived, crouching prudently
behind a thick fir-bush, to reconnoitre before he
sprang out into the grass, she was bounding frantically
from one side of the stream to the other,
her enormously thick tail upstretched stiffly, as a
sort of rudder, through the course of each prodigious
leap. For a moment or two the pair put
their heads together, and the mother, apparently,
succeeded in conveying the situation to her mate
in some singularly laconic speech. Almost at
once, as it seemed, their plans were completed.
The two started downstream, one along each bank.
A couple of minutes more, and the man&rsquo;s trail
was picked up by the female. A low cry notified
the male, and he instantly sprang across and joined
her.</p>
<p>It seems probable, from the female&rsquo;s future
actions, that the two bereaved animals had now a
fairly right idea of what had happened. The absence
of blood, or sign of disturbance in the den
or on the trail, conveyed to them the impression
that their little ones had been carried off alive,
<span class="pb" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
because, to a wild creature, death is naturally associated
with blood. It is possible, moreover, that
there was nothing so very strange to them in the
fact that the man should wish to carry off their cubs
alive. What was so precious to themselves might
very well be precious to others also. Mother
birds, and mother quadrupeds as well, have been
known, not infrequently, to steal each other&rsquo;s
young. If, then, the panthers imagined that their
kidnapped little ones were still alive, the furious
quest on which they now set forth had a double
object&mdash;vengeance and rescue.</p>
<p>They ran one behind the other, the female
leading, and they went as noiselessly as blown
feathers, for all their bulk. From time to time,
being but short-winded runners, and accustomed
rather to brief and violent than to long-continued
effort, they would pause for breath, sniffing at
the trail as it grew rapidly fresher, and seeming to
take counsel together. Their pursuit at length
grew more stealthy, as they approached the further
side of the timbered valley, and realized that their
enemy could not now be very far ahead.</p>
<p>The two panthers knew all that it concerned
them to know about the man, except his object in
robbing them of their little ones. They had often
watched him, followed him, studied him, when he
little guessed their scrutiny. They knew where
<span class="pb" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
he lived, in the cabin with one door and one window,
at the back of the stumpy clearing on the
side of Broken Ridge. They knew his wife, the
straight, swarthy, hard-featured woman, who wore
always some bright scarlet thing around her neck
and on her head. They knew his black-and-white
cow, with the bell at her neck, which made sounds
they did not like. They knew his yoke of raw-boned
red steers, which ploughed among the
stumps for him in the spring, and hauled logs for
him, laboriously, in the winter. They knew the
disquieting brilliance which would shine from his
window or his open door in nights when all the forest
was in darkness. Above all, they knew of his
incomprehensible power of killing at a distance,
viewlessly. On account of this terrible power, they
had tried to avoid giving him offence. They had
refrained from hunting his cow or his steers; they
had even respected his foolish, cackling chickens,
being resolved in no way to risk drawing down
his vengeance upon them. Now, however, it was
different.</p>
<p>As the two grim avengers followed the trail,
like fleeting shadows, a red doe stepped leisurely
into their path before she caught sight of them.
For one instant she stood like a stone, petrified
with terror. In the next, she had vanished over
the nearest bushes with such a leap as she had
<span class="pb" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
never before achieved. The female might have
sprung upon her neck almost without effort.
But she never even raised a paw against this easy
quarry; it was a higher hunting that now engrossed
her.</p>
<p>When at length the two running beasts came to
the edge of the open ground on the slopes of
Broken Ridge, they hesitated. The female, though
the more deadly in the persistence of her hate,
was at the same time the more sagacious. First
of all, she wanted to recover her cubs. No mere
vengeance could be so important to her as that.
She shrank back into deeper cover, and started
off to one side to skirt the dangerous open. But
noticing that her mate was not following her, she
stopped and looked back at him inquiringly.</p>
<p>The male, more impetuous and more bent upon
mere revenge, showed himself for a moment beyond
the fringe of the woods. In that one moment,
though it was impossible that he should
have detected the man in his hiding across the
open, he nevertheless seemed to receive some
impression from the man&rsquo;s challenging eyes. He
felt that his enemy was there, in that dense clump
of young firs. Instantly he dropped upon his
belly in the undergrowth, flattening himself to an
amazingly inconspicuous figure. Then he began
creeping, slowly and with infinite stealth, out
<span class="pb" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
across the space of peril, beneath the full, revealing
glare of the sun. The female gave vent to a
low whimper, trying to call him back. Failing
in that, she stood and watched him anxiously.</p>
<p>She could just see his tawny back moving
through the light green leafage of the scrub. He
was crawling more swiftly now. He had covered
nearly half the distance. All at once there came
a spurt of flame from the fir thicket, and a sharp
cracking report. In the next instant she saw her
mate rise straight into the air on his hind legs,
clawing savagely. Then he seemed to fall together
and tumble over backwards.</p>
<p>She knew very well what had happened. This
was the power of the man. She knew her mate
was dead. A further sullen heat was added to
her hate, but it did not make her reckless. She
ran away down the slope, skirted the open at a
safe distance, and closed in once more upon the
man&rsquo;s trail a good mile farther on. She had got
ahead of the fugitive, for even now she heard the
faint thud-thud of his loping feet. She hid herself
far up a tree, some thirty feet from the trail,
and waited.</p>
<p>As the man came up, she eyed him with a
mingling of mad hatred and anxious question.
She saw the bundle on his back writhe violently,
and she caught a little growling complaint which
<span class="pb" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
came from it. That settled her policy. Had
she thought that the cubs were dead, she might
have dropped upon the man from her post
of vantage. But the cubs were alive. For
their sakes she would take no risks with the
man.</p>
<p>When he had passed on, she followed at a safe
distance. The strange procession crossed the
ridge. It neared the clearing and the cabin. At
this point the panther heard, some little way back
from the trail, the tonk-tonk of a cow-bell. There
was no need of following the man so very closely
for the moment. She swerved aside, ran straight,
like a cat going for milk, through the thickets,
and, with a burst of intolerable fury, sprang upon
the cow&rsquo;s neck. There was not even a struggle,
for the animal&rsquo;s neck was broken before it had
time to know what was happening. The desperate
mother tore her victim, but ate none of it.
Then she hurried on toward the cabin. At least
she had tasted some beginnings of vengeance.</p>
<p>As she reached the edge of the clearing, and
came in sight of the cabin, the man was just
entering the door, with the precious bundle in his
hands. She saw the door close behind him. At
this she whimpered uneasily, and started around
to skirt the clearing and come upon the cabin
from the rear.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">[121]</div>
<p>As she went, she caught sight of the two red
steers, feeding in the pasture field close by the
fence. She crept up, eying them, but too sagacious
to reveal herself in the open. As luck
would have it, one of the steers at this moment
came up close to the fence, to scratch his hide on
the knots. With a snarl the panther struck at
him through the rails, and drew a long ragged
gash down his flank. Snorting with pain and
terror, the steer turned and raced for home, tail
in air; and his comrade, taking the alarm, bellowed
nervously and followed him.</p>
<p>A few minutes later the man came out of his
cabin, followed by his wife. The steers were at
the barn door&mdash;a place they usually avoided at
this season. One of them was shivering and
bleeding. The man examined the wound, and
understood. Turning to the woman, he said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That there&rsquo;s the <i>mother&rsquo;s</i> work. We must
hunt her down an&rsquo; settle her to-morrer, or she&rsquo;ll
clean out the farm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Letting the frightened steers into the barn, he
waited anxiously for the <i>tonk-atonk</i> of the black-and-white
cow coming home to be milked. When
she did not come, that, too, he understood only
too well, and his wide mouth set itself grimly.
It looked as if those were going to be an expensive
pair of cubs.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">[122]</div>
<p>After dark, late, the mother stole close up to
the cabin. Everything was shut up tight&mdash;barn,
shed, and house alike. At the door-sill she listened
long and intently, like a cat at a mouse-hole.
Her fine ear made out the heavy breathings of
the man and the woman within. It also at length
distinguished some faint little growlings and gruntings,
such as the cubs only uttered when they
were well fed. She prowled around the house all
night, the pale flame of her savage and anxious
eyes glowing upon it from every direction. Then,
at the edge of dawn, she stole away, but not far,
to a hiding-place whence she could command a
view of the cabin-door. It was within that door
that her cubs had vanished.</p>
<p>The sun was not a half hour high when the
man set forth, and the woman with him, to hunt
down the dangerous adversary whom they had
challenged. The woman, who carried a rifle of
the same pattern as the man&rsquo;s, was almost as sure
a shot as he. The continued absence of the cow,
the wound on the red steer&rsquo;s flank, the defiant
network of tracks all about the cabin, showed
clearly enough that the fight was now to the
death. The man and woman knew there would
be no security for them as long as the mother
panther remained alive. Therefore they were in
haste to settle the matter. They picked out a
<span class="pb" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
distinct trail and followed it. It led them straight
to the body of the slain cow, which the slayer had
visited twice in the course of the night, just to
satisfy her thirst for vengeance.</p>
<p>But at the moment when the two indignant
hunters were examining the carcass of the cow,
the panther was at their cabin-door, listening.
She had seen the man and woman hurry away.
Now she could hear quite distinctly the little
complainings of her young. She pushed against
the heavy door till it creaked, but there was no
entrance for her by that way. Close by was the
window. Standing up on her hind legs, she stared
in. At last she managed to make out the two
cubs, lying in a corner in a box of rags and straw.
The sight scattered all her caution to the winds.
Scrambling up to the window-sill, she dashed her
head and shoulders through the glass. That the
jagged fragments cut her mouth and muzzle severely,
she never heeded at all. Forcing her whole
body through, her powerful haunches caught the
window-frame, and carried it with them to the
floor. Writhing herself free of this encumbrance,
she darted to the box of rags, snatched up one of
the cubs by the loose skin of its neck, sprang
through the window with it, and bore it off into a
growth of tall rank grass behind the barn. Returning
at once to the cabin, she rescued the other
<span class="pb" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
cub in the same way, and brought it triumphantly
to its brother in the long grass.</p>
<p>About this time she heard the man and the
woman coming back. Instead of trying to get
away, she coiled herself flat in the grass and began
to suckle the cubs to keep them quiet. Her
hiding-place was the most secure that she could
have found within miles of the cabin, the man
having never any occasion to go behind the barn&mdash;as
she had seen by the absence of tracks&mdash;and
the rank growth furnishing a very complete concealment.
Crafty woodsman though the man
was held to be, it never entered his mind that so
shy a beast as the panther would take covert thus
within the very stronghold of the foe. At sight
of the shattered window he fell into a rage, and
when he found the cubs gone, he exhausted ingenuity
in consigning to every torment the man
who had tempted him into speculating in panther
cubs. Storming noisily, he hunted everywhere,
except behind the barn. For a time his wife sat
composedly on the wood-pile, and cheered him
with pointed backwoods sarcasms. At last, however,
the two went away over the ridge, to recover
the skin of the other panther before it should
be spoiled by foxes. During their absence the
mother got both cubs safely carried off to a hollow
tree some five miles farther along the ridge. That
<span class="pb" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
night, while the man and the woman slept, with
boards nailed over their window, she bore them
far away from the perilous neighborhood. By
difficult paths, and across two turbulent streams,
she removed them into the recesses of the neighboring
county, a barren and difficult region,
where the wanderings of the man were little
likely to lead him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">[127]</div>
<h2 id="c8">THE TUNNEL RUNNERS</h2>
<p>The deep copper-red channel of the little
tidal river wound inland through the wide
yellowish levels of the salt marsh. Along each
side of the channel, between the waving fringes
of the grass and the line of usual high tide, ran a
margin of pale yellowish-brown sand-flats, baked
and seamed with sun cracks, scurfed with wavy
deposits of salt, and spotted with meagre tufts of
sea-green samphire, goose-tongue, and sea-rosemary.
Just at the edge of the grass-fringe an
old post, weather-beaten and time-eaten, stood
up a solitary sentinel over the waste, reminder of
a time when this point of the river had been a
little haven for fishing-boats&mdash;a haven long since
filled up by the caprice of the inexorable silt.</p>
<p>Some forty or fifty paces straight back from the
mouldering post, a low spur of upland, darkly
wooded with spruce and fir, jutted out into the
yellow-green sea of grass. Off to the left, some
hundred yards or so away, ran a line of round-topped
dike, with a few stiff mullein stalks fringing
its crest. Beyond the dike, and long ago
reclaimed by it from the sea, lay basking in the
<span class="pb" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
sun the vast expanses of sweet-grass meadow,
blue-green with timothy, clover, and vetch, and
hummed over by innumerable golden-belted
bumblebees. Through this sweet meadow
wound the slow curves of a placid and brimming
fresh-water stream, joining itself at last to the
parent river through an <i>abat-d&rsquo;eaux</i> in the dike,
whose sunken valves protected it completely from
the fluctuation of the tides.</p>
<p>The dividing line between the tall, waving,
yellow salt grass and the naked mud-flat was as
sharp as if cut by a diker&rsquo;s spade, and it was
fringed by a close brown tangle of grass-roots,
which seemed to feel outward over the baked
mud and then curl back upon themselves in apprehension.
Close to the foot of the mouldering
post, where this fringe half encircled it, appeared
suddenly a pointed brownish head, with tiny ears
and a pair of little, bright, bead-like eyes set very
close together. The head was thrust cautiously
forth from the mouth of a narrow tunnel under
the grass-roots. The sharp, overhung muzzle,
with nostrils dilating and quivering, interrogated
the perilous outer air; the bead eyes searched the
sky, the grass-fringe, the baking open of the flat.
There was no danger in sight; but just in front,
some five or six feet distant, a gaudy caterpillar
on some bold venture bent was making his slow
<span class="pb" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
way across the scurfed mud, from one goose-tongue
tuft to another.</p>
<p>The pointed head shot swiftly forth from the
tunnel, followed by a ruddy-brown body&mdash;straight
out across the bright naked space, and back again,
like a darting shuttle, into the hole, and the too
rashly adventuring caterpillar had disappeared.</p>
<p>A little way back from the edge of the flats a
mottled brown marsh-hawk was flying hither and
thither. His wings were shorter and broader
than those of most members of his swift marauding
race, and he flew flapping almost like a crow,
instead of gliding, skimming, and soaring, after
the manner of his more aristocratic kindred. He
flew close above the swaying grass-tops, his head
thrust downward, and his hard, unwinking eyes
peered fiercely down between the ranked coarse
stems of the &ldquo;broad-leaf&rdquo; grass. He quartered
the meadow section by section, closely and methodically
as a well-handled setter. Once he
dropped straight downward into the grass abruptly,
as if he had been shot; and when, an instant
later, he arose again, with a great buffeting of the
grass-tops, he was clutching some tiny gray object
in his talons. Had one been near enough to
see, it would have proved, probably, to be a
young shrew. Whatever it was, it was too small
to be worth carrying off to his high perch on the
<span class="pb" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
dead pine-tree beyond the ridge of the uplands.
He flew with it to the open crest of the dike
close by, where he devoured it in savage gulps.
Then, having wiped his beak on the hard sod, he
dropped off the dike and resumed his assiduous
quartering of the salt grass.</p>
<p>About this time the little brown, pointed head
with the bead eyes reappeared in the mouth of
the tunnel by the foot of the post. Everything
seemed safe. The samphire and the goose-tongue
tufts, palely glimmering in the sun, were full of
salt-loving, heat-loving insects. Warily the
ruddy-brown body behind the pointed head
slipped forth from the tunnel, and darted to the
nearest tuft, where it began nosing sharply and
snapping up small game.</p>
<p>The marsh-mouse was a sturdy figure, about
six inches in length, with a dull chestnut-brown
back sprinkled with black hairs shading downwards
through warm gray to a delicate fawn-colored
belly. Its shoulders and short forelegs were
heavily moulded, showing the digger of tunnels,
and its forepaws moved with the swift precise
facility of hands. The tiny ears were set flat
and tight to the head, and the broad-based skull
over the triangular muzzle gave an impression of
pugnacious courage, very unlike that of the wood-mouse
or the house-mouse. This expression was
<span class="pb" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
more than justified by the fact, for the marsh-mouse,
confident in his punishing little jaws and
distrustful of his agility, had a dangerous propensity
to stay and fight when he ought to be running
away. It was a propensity which, owing to the
abundance of his enemies, would have led speedily
to the extermination of his race but for the amazing
and unremitting fecundity which dwelt in his
blood.</p>
<p>For all his courage, however, there were some
foes which he had no inclination to meet and face&mdash;even
he, one of the biggest and strongest of
his kind. As he glanced aside from his nosing
in the samphire tufts, he caught sight of a broad
black splotch of shadow sweeping up the baked
surface of the flat at terrific speed.</p>
<p>He did not look up; he had no need to.
Only too well he knew what was casting that
sinister shadow. Though agility was not supposed
to be his strong point, his movement, as
he shot across the open from the samphire tuft
to the mouth of his tunnel, was almost too quick
to follow. He gained the root-fringed door just
in time. As his frantic, cringing hind quarters
disappeared into the hole, the great talons of the
pouncing hawk plunged into the root-fringe, closing
and clutching so savagely that the mouth of
the tunnel was obliterated. Grass-roots, however,
<span class="pb" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
were not what those rending talons wanted, and
the great hawk, rising angrily, flapped off to the
other side of the dike.</p>
<p>Within the tunnel the brown mouse ran on
desperately, as if he felt those fatal talons still
reaching after him. The tunnel was not quite in
darkness, for here and there a gleam of light came
filtering through the roots which formed its roof,
and here and there a round opening gave access to
the yellow-green world among the big stiff grass-stalks.
The floor was smooth from the feet and
teeth of countless other marsh-mice, water-voles,
and marsh-shrews. To right and left went branching
off innumerable side-tunnels and galleries, an
apparently inextricable maze. But the brown
mouse raced straight on, back from the waterside,
deep into the heart of the marsh, anxious only to
put himself as far as possible from the scene of his
horrid adventure.</p>
<p>Running thus suddenly, he bumped hard into
a little wayfarer who was journeying in the opposite
direction. The tunnel was so narrow that
only by the use of a certain circumspection and
consideration could two travellers pass each other
comfortably. Now the stranger was a mole-shrew,
much smaller than the brown mouse, but of a
temper as unpleasant as that of a mad buffalo.
That the mouse should come butting into him in
<span class="pb" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
that rude fashion was an indignity not to be tolerated.
Gnashing his long, chisel-like teeth, he
grappled blindly, and rent the brown mouse&rsquo;s ear
to ribbons. But this was a mistake on his part,
a distinct error of judgment. The brown mouse
was no slim timorous barn-mouse or field-mouse,
no slow and clumsy mole. He was a fighter and
with strength to back his pugnacity. He caught
the angry shrew by the neck, bit him mercilessly,
shook him limp, trod him under foot, and raced
on. Not until he reached his snug nest in the
burrow at the foot of the dike did he quite regain
his equanimity.</p>
<p>Just about this time there came a succession of
heavy southwest gales, which piled up the water
into the funnel-like head of the bay, dammed back
the rivers, and brought a series of high tides.
Tides as high were quite unseasonable, and caught
the swarming little tunnel runners of the salt
marsh unprepared. As the first flood came lapping
up over the sun-baked flats, covering the
samphire tufts, setting all awash the root-fringes
of the grass, and sliding noiselessly into the tunnels,
there was a wild scurrying, and a faint elusive
clamor of squeaks came murmuring thinly up
through the grass. Myriads of brown-and-orange
grasshoppers, beetles black and green and blue
and red, with here and there a sleek grub, here
<span class="pb" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
and there a furry caterpillar, began to climb the
long, stiff grass-stalks. The battalions of the mice
and voles and shrews, popping up indignantly
through the skylight of the tunnels, swept unanimously
toward the barrier of the dike. Every
one of them knew quite well that to the sweet
meadows beyond the dike the peril of the tide
could not pursue them.</p>
<p>The big brown marsh-mouse, as it chanced,
was asleep at the bottom of his burrow. Stealing
up between the grass-stems, a chill douche
slipped in upon him. Startled and choking, he
darted up the steep slope of his gallery, and out
into the wet turmoil. He was an expert swimmer,
but he liked to choose his own time for the
exercise of his skill. This was not one of the
times. For one second he sat up upon his sturdy
little haunches, squeaking angrily and surveying
the excitement. Then, shaking his fur free of the
few drops of water which clung to it in tiny
globules, he joined the scurrying migrant throngs
which were swarming through the dike.</p>
<p>Along the dike-top the migrants were running
the gantlet with death. With the first invasion
of the tide across the flats, all the marsh-hawks
of the neighborhood&mdash;some four or five&mdash;had
gathered to the hunt, knowing well just what the
flood would do for them. Also many crows had
<span class="pb" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
come. At intervals along the crest of the dike
stood the hawks, with wings half spread, screaming
excitedly, clutching at their victims and devouring
them with unlordly haste. Two, already
gorged, were flapping away heavily toward the
forest-clad inland ridges, carrying limp trophies
in their talons. As for the crows, there were
perhaps two score of them, all cawing noisily, flying
low along the crest of the dike, and alighting
from time to time to stab savagely with their
dagger-like beaks.</p>
<p>The big brown marsh-mouse, wise with experience
and many escapes, took this all in as he
mounted the slope of the dike. Marking a hawk
just above him, he doubled nimbly back, jumping
over half a dozen blindly blundering fugitives.
Some ten feet farther along he again ascended.
As he came over the crest, in a mob of shrews
and smaller mice, he saw a glossy crow just dropping
upon him. The eyes of the crow, impish
and malevolent, were fixed, not upon him, but
upon a small shrew close at his side. Imagining
himself, however, the object of attack, the brown
mouse fell into a rage. Darting upward, he fixed
his long teeth in the black marauder&rsquo;s thigh, just
above the leg joint, and pulled him down into
the scurrying stream of rodents. With a squeak
of rage and alarm, the crow struck out savagely.
<span class="pb" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
His murderous beak stabbed this way and that in
the crowd, laying out more than one soft-bodied
victim, while his strong black wings beat others
into confusion and panic. But in the throng
swarming over the dike at that point were many
more of the marsh-mice and the shrews, all savage
in temper. They leaped upon the crow, ran
over and bore down the buffeting wings, and tore
vengefully at the hard iridescent armor of close-laid
feathers which shielded their foe from any
fatal wounds. In spite of this disadvantage, they
were wearing him out by sheer fury and weight
of numbers, when the other crows came darkly to
his assistance. In a moment he was liberated,
and the dike-top strewn with gashed furry bodies.
Bleeding and bedraggled, his eyes blazing with
wrath, he sprang into the air and flapped away to
the uplands to recover his composure in the
seclusion of some dense pine-top. The brown
marsh-mouse, the cause of his discomfiture, darted
out from under his wing as he arose, and slipped
over the edge of the dike with no worse injury
than a red gash across the haunches. Having
scored such a triumph over so redoubtable an
enemy as the crow, he was not troubled by his
wound; but discretion led him to plunge instantly
into the deep green shelter of the grass.</p>
<p>Here in the sweet meadow, where the timothy
<span class="pb" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
and clover stood much closer than did the coarse
stalks of the &ldquo;broad-leaf&rdquo; in the salt meadow,
the runways of the mice were not, as a rule,
underground. They were made by gnawing off
the stems close to the firm surface of the sod.
The stems on each side, tending to be pressed
together, formed a perfect roof to the narrow
tunnels, which pierced the grass in every direction
and formed a seemingly insoluble labyrinth.
The brown mouse, however, knew his way very
well through the soft green light, flecked with
specks and streaks of pollen-dusty sunshine.
The tunnels were swarming with travellers; but
beyond nipping them on the haunches now and
then, to make them get out of his way or move
faster, he paid no attention to them. At last he
came to the edge of the stream, and to a burrow
beneath the roots of a wild-rose thicket which
fringed the water.</p>
<p>This burrow the brown mouse had once inhabited.
He felt it was his. Just now it was
occupied by an irritable little mole-shrew; but
the brown mouse, strong in the sense of ownership,
proceeded to take possession. The outraged
shrew put up a bitter fight, but in vain. With
squeaks and blood the eviction was accomplished,
and the brown mouse established himself complacently
in the burrow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">[140]</div>
<p>After a few days the southwest gales blew
themselves out, the tides drew back within their
ordinary summer bounds, and most of the refugees
returned to their old haunts among the
&ldquo;broad-leaf.&rdquo; But the brown mouse elected to
remain in his burrow beside the rose-thicket.
His taste had turned to the clover and timothy
stalks, and the meadow was alive with brown
crickets and toothsome, big, green grasshoppers.
Moreover, in the heat of late July, he loved to
swim in the bland waters of the stream, keeping
close along shore, under the shadow of the long
grass and the overhanging roses, and avoiding the
dense patches of weed which might give shelter
to the darting pickerel. His burrow was roomy
and gave accommodation to a silken-furred brown
mate, who set herself without delay to the duty
of replenishing the diminished population of the
marsh-mice.</p>
<p>In spite of foraging hawks, foxes, weasels, and
minks, in spite of calamities, swift and frequent,
overtaking this, that, and another of the innumerable
kindred of the mice, the summer hours
passed benignly over the burrow by the rose-thicket.
Then, one sultry scented morning, there
came a change. The deep quiet of the meadow
went to pieces in blatant clamor. Loud-voiced
men and snorting, trampling, clanking horses
<span class="pb" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
came to the edge of the grass, and with them two
strange scarlet machines which clattered as they
moved.</p>
<p>One of these scarlet monsters, dragged by its
horses, swerved off toward the farther side of the
meadow. The other started straight down through
the deep grass along the edge of the stream.
Into the grass, belly-deep, the big horses plunged,
breasting it like the sea. Instantly the scarlet
machine, which was ridden by a man, set up a
new cry. It was a harsh, strident, terrifying cry,
as if a million twanging locusts had found one
voice. Before it, to the amazed horror of all the
furry, scurrying grass-dwellers, the grass went
down flat in long ranks. The peril of the floods
was as nothing to this loud uncomprehended
peril. Marsh-mice, water-voles, shrews, with here
and there a foraging musk-rat, here and there a
murderous and ravaging weasel, all fled frantically
before it. A few, a very few, fled too late.
These never knew what happened to them, for
great darting knives, dancing unseen through the
grass close to the earth, caught them and slew
them.</p>
<p>The high cry of the deadly scarlet thing, however,
gave warning fair and sufficient. As the big
brown marsh-mouse heard it approaching, he
dived straight to the bottom of his burrow and
<span class="pb" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
lay there trembling. His companion, on the
other hand, holding different views as to the
proper place of safety, darted from the burrow,
wriggled through the thorny stems of the rose-thicket,
and plunged into the water, where she
hid herself close under the opposite bank. The
noise and the darting knives glided almost over
the mouth of the burrow, and the thumping heart
of the brown mouse almost burst itself with terror.
But they passed. Slowly they marched
away. And when they had grown comparatively
faint, far down at the foot of the meadow, beside
the dike, the brown mouse, recovering himself,
dared to peep forth. He was astonished to see
a long breadth of grass lying prostrate, with bewildered
bumblebees and grasshoppers striving
to extricate themselves from the ruins. Having
a valiant heart and a quick eye for opportunity,
he sprang out of his hole and began pouncing on
the confused and helpless insects. This, for a
few minutes, was a profitable game, and a safe
one, too, for the strident noise, with the presence
of the men and horses, had driven hawks and
crows to a discreet distance. But presently the
cry of the scarlet thing, which had turned at the
dike and was moving straight up the middle of
the meadow, began to grow loud again, and the
brown mouse whisked back into his burrow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">[143]</div>
<p>All through the time of the haying the meadow-folk
lived in a turmoil of alarm and change.
At first, under the heavy prostrate ranks of the
slain grass, they ran bewildered but secure, for
their foes could not easily detect them. For another
day they were comparatively safe under the
long scented lines of the dying &ldquo;windrows,&rdquo; full
of grasshoppers and wilted clover-heads. When
the windrows were tossed together into innumerable
pointed hay-cocks, they crowded beneath
the ephemeral shelter, to be rudely bared next
day to the blinding sun as the cocks were pitched
into the rumbling hay-carts. It was a day of horrors,
this, to the meadow kindreds, for a yellow
Irish terrier, following the hay-makers, would run
with wild yelpings under the lifted cocks, and slay
the little people by the hundred. But as for the
brown mouse, all this time he and his temporary
mate dwelt secure, keeping to their burrow and to
the barren but safe tunnels which they had driven
amid the roots of the rose-thicket.</p>
<p>When the hay was gone&mdash;part of it carted
away to upland barns, part built cunningly into
high conical stacks&mdash;the meadow-dwellers found
that they had fallen on evil times. The naked
meadow, all bare close stubble, open to the eyes
of hawk and crow by day, and of the still more
deadly owl by night, had become their worst foe.
<span class="pb" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
Some drew back to the fringes of the uplands.
Some colonized along the winding edges of the
stream. Some returned across the dike to the
salt meadow, where the broad-leaf grass was not
yet ripe for mowing; while the remnant huddled
precariously under the bases of the stacks, an
easy prey for every foraging weasel. In a little
while, however, the short thick herbage of the
aftermath thrust its head above the stubble.
Then new tunnels were run, and life for the
scurrying and squeaking meadow-folk once more
began to offer its normal attractions. It was now
more perilously insecure, however, for the herds
of cattle turned to pasture on the aftermath kept
it eaten down; and the shrewd crows learned that
their beaks could pierce the fragile and too-open
roofs of the tunnels.</p>
<p>At last the snow came, the deep snow and the
hard cold, enemy to almost all the other kindred
of the wild, but friendly to the mouse-folk. The
snow, some two feet deep all over the meadows,
over the dikes, and to the eating edges of the
tides, gave them a perfect shelter, and was exactly
suited to the driving of their tunnels. Food was
abundant, because they could subsist very well on
the nutritious root-stalks of the grass. And none
of their enemies could get at them except when
they chose to seek the upper air. In the daytime
<span class="pb" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
they kept to the glimmering blue light of
the tunnels, but at night they would slip forth
and play about the firm surface of the snow. It
was then that they suffered, for though the hawks
were gone, and the crows asleep, the icy winter
night was alive with owls; and foxes, weasels, and
minks would come prowling hungrily down from
the uplands. The owls were the worst peril by
far&mdash;marsh-owls, barn-owls, the darting little
Acadian owls, swift as the sparrow-hawk; and
now and then the terror of the winter wilds, the
giant snowy owl of the North, driven down by
storm and famine from his bleak Arctic wastes.
The revels of the mouse-folk over their dim-lit
playgrounds were varied with incessant tragedy.
But the memories of the little people, fortunately,
were short. Their perilous diversions went on
unchecked, while their furry battalions thinned
amazingly.</p>
<p>But through all these dangers the brown marsh-mouse
went his way secure. He kept every exit
of his tunnels perfectly hidden among the thorny
tips of the wild rose-bushes, which stood up some
five or six inches above the top of the snow. The
successive families which were born and grew up
in his safe burrow passed out into the maze, to
be merged in the precarious and passing legions.
His first mate disappeared mysteriously, and as
<span class="pb" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
he had no facilities for pressing an inquiry among
the hawks or weasels, he never knew the details
of her disappearance. Her place was speedily
filled in the burrow. But to the brown mouse
himself nothing happened. He confined his
nightly revels beneath the moon to the region
of the rose-thickets, and so eluded effectually the
eyes and claws of the owls.</p>
<p>It was along toward the end of winter, however,
when the brown mouse met with his most dangerous
adventure. Shunning, as he did so craftily,
the games on the open snow, he was wont to
amuse himself&mdash;and incidentally seek variations
in his diet&mdash;beneath the ice of his threshold
stream. An expert swimmer and diver, almost
as swift as his cousin the musk-rat or his hereditary
enemy the mink, he would swim long distances
under the water, finding fresh bits of
lily-root, tiny clams, water-snails, half-torpid
beetles, and many kinds of larv&aelig;. As the
stream had been high at the time of freezing,
and had afterwards shrunken in its channel, letting
the ice down with it, there were many air-chambers
along the brink, between ice-roof and
water surface; and slanting downward to the
nearest of these he had dug himself a tunnel
from the roots of his thicket. Even here, to be
sure, there were perils for him. There was one
<span class="pb" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
big mink which loved to hunt along these secret
and dim-lit air-chambers, taking long swims beneath
the ice. But he was an autocrat, and kept
all rival minks away from his range; so the wise
brown mouse knew that as long as he kept a
sharp enough lookout against that foe, he was
secure in the air-chambers. Then, in the stream
itself, there was always the peril of the great pike,
which had its lair at the bottom of the deep pool
down by the <i>abat-d&rsquo;eaux</i>. The brown mouse had
seen him but once&mdash;a long, straight, gray-green,
shadowy shape in the distance&mdash;but that one
sight gave him counsels of caution. He never
forgot, when in the water, to keep watch for that
great darting shadow.</p>
<p>One day, when the brown mouse had swum
far downstream, and was hurrying back home,
he was alarmed by loud sounds on the surface of
the ice, a little below his back door. Some one
with an axe was chopping a hole in the ice. The
brown mouse swam away downstream again as
fast as he could, and the jarring noise of the axe-strokes,
carried by the ice and by the water, seemed
to follow him with terrifying concussions. Hiding
himself in a remote air-chamber, he waited for
the noises to cease. Then, with mingled trepidation
and caution, he swam upstream again.</p>
<p>As he neared home, he saw a round beam of
<span class="pb" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
light pouring downward to the stream&rsquo;s bed
through a hole in the ice. In the midst of this
light there hung, moving softly to the slow current,
a big lump of fat pork. The brown mouse did
not know it was pork, but he knew at once it was
something very good to eat. Very cautiously he
swam up to investigate it. There seemed to be
no reason why he should not nibble it. In fact,
he was just going to nibble it, when, just a few
feet farther upstream, those terrifying sounds
began again. The brown mouse took them as a
warning, and fled back downstream in a panic.</p>
<p>In a few minutes the noise stopped, and the
courage of the brown mouse returned. As he
swam once more homeward, firmly resolved that
he would taste that delectable mystery on his way,
a chill in his spine made him remember the great
pike, and look back.</p>
<p>There <i>was</i> the great pike, a long dreadful
shadow, gliding up behind him.</p>
<p>The brown mouse, as we have said, was a
wonderful swimmer. He swam now as he had
never swum before&mdash;a brown streak cleaving the
dim-lit current; and as he went tiny water-bubbles,
formed by the air pressed out from under his fur,
flew up till they broke against the ice. But, with
all his speed, the great pike swam faster, and was
slowly overtaking him. Just as he passed that
<span class="pb" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
strange dangling lump of pork, he realized that
this was a race which he could not win. The
entrance to his burrow was still too distant. But
he remembered a tiny air-chamber under the bank
close by. It had no exit. It was so small that
he might not find room there to haul himself
clear out of the water, beyond reach of his enemy&rsquo;s
jaws, but he had no choice, and in frantic suffocating
desperation he dashed for it.</p>
<p>Even as he turned, however, the sense of doom
descended upon him. Was he not already too
late? The long awful shape of the great fish
was close upon him. With a convulsive effort
that almost burst his heart, he gained the air-chamber,
scrambled half-way out of the water, and
then, in that cramped space, turned at bay, game
to the last gasp.</p>
<p>To his amazement, the great pike was not at
his tail. Instead, he was still some three or four
feet away, out there just in the descending beam
of light from the hole in the ice. The mysterious
lump of pork had disappeared, but the gasping
brown mouse did not notice that. His attention
was engrossed in the amazing and terrifying performances
of the pike. The long gray-green
body was darting this way and that, in and out of
the beam of light, but never any great space out
of it. The great jaws shook savagely from side
<span class="pb" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
to side, and then the mouse saw that from between
them a slender gleaming cord extended upward
through the hole. A moment more, and the pike
sprang straight up, with a heavy swirl of the water,
and vanished above the ice.</p>
<p>It was incomprehensible; and there was something
altogether appalling about it. The brown
mouse shivered. For several minutes he crouched
there quite still, more utterly panic-stricken than
he had ever been before in all his precarious little
life. At last, with hesitation, he worked his way up
along the bank, beneath the ice, to his own tunnel,
and scurried in all haste to hide himself in the
deepest corner of his burrow. And never thereafter
could he comprehend why nothing more was
seen, or heard, or rumored of the great pike.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">[151]</div>
<h2 id="c9">A TORPEDO IN FEATHERS</h2>
<p>The blue kingfisher, flying over the still
surface of the lake, and peering downward
curiously as he flew, saw into its depths as
if they had been clear glass. What he hoped to
see was some small fish&mdash;chub, or shiner, or
yellow perch, or trout, basking incautiously near
the surface. What he saw was a sinister dark
shape, elongated but massive, darting in a straight
line through the transparent amber, some three or
four feet below the surface. Knowing well enough
what that meant&mdash;no fish so foolish as to linger
in such dread neighborhood&mdash;the kingfisher flew
on indignantly, with a loud clattering laugh like a
rattle. He would do his fishing, according to his
usual custom, in the shallower waters along shore,
where the great black loon was less at home.</p>
<p>Darting straight ahead for an amazing distance,
like a well-aimed torpedo, the loon came to a point
where the lake-bottom slanted upward swiftly
toward a bushy islet, over a floor of yellow sand
that glowed in the sun. Here he just failed to
transfix, with his powerful dagger of a bill, a big
lake trout that hung, lazily waving its scarlet fins,
<span class="pb" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
beside a rock. The trout&rsquo;s golden-rimmed eyes
detected the peril in time&mdash;just in time&mdash;and
with a desperate screw-like thrust of his powerful
tail, he shot aside and plunged into the shadowy
deeps. The heavy swirl of his going disturbed
an eight-inch chub, which chanced at the moment
to be groping for larv&aelig; in a muddy pocket beneath
the rock. Incautiously it sailed forth to see what
was happening. Before it had time to see anything,
fate struck it. Caught in the vice of two
iron mandibles, it was carried quivering to the
surface.</p>
<p>All power of escape crushed out of it by that
saw-toothed grip, the victim might safely have
been dropped and devoured at leisure. But the
great loon was too hungry for leisure. Moreover,
he was an expert and he took no risks. With a
jerk he threw the fish into the air, caught it as it
fell head first, and gulped it down. For a moment
or two he floated motionless, his small, fierce
and peculiarly piercing eyes warily scrutinizing
the lake in all directions. Then, lifting his black
head, which gleamed in the sun with green, purple,
and sapphire iridescence, he gave vent to a strange
wild cry like a peal of bitter laughter. The cry
echoed hollowly from the desolate shores of the
lake. A moment or two later it was answered,
in the same hollow and disconcerting tones, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
from behind the islet his mate came swimming to
meet him.</p>
<p>For a few minutes the two great birds swam
slowly around each other, uttering several times
their weird cry. As they floated at their ease, unalarmed,
they sat high in the water, showing something
of the clean pearly whiteness of their breasts
and under parts. Their sturdy, trimly modelled
bodies were about three feet in length, from the
tips of their straight and formidable green beaks
to the ends of their short stiff tails. Their heads,
as we have seen, were of an intense and iridescent
black, their necks encircled by collars of black and
white, their backs, shoulders, and wings dull black,
with white spots and bars. Their feet, very large,
broadly webbed, and set extraordinarily far back,
almost like those of a penguin, glimmered black
as they fanned back and forth in the clear amber
water.</p>
<p>Suddenly some movement among the bushes
along the near shore, perhaps two hundred yards
away, caught their watchful eyes. In an instant,
by some mysterious process, they had sunk their
bodies completely below the surface, leaving only
their snaky heads and necks exposed to view.
This peculiar submerged position they held, it
seemed, without difficulty. But whatever it was
that alarmed them, it was not repeated; and after
<span class="pb" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
perhaps five minutes of cautious watchfulness,
they slowly emerged and floated on the surface.
Presently the female swam back again behind the
islet, laboriously scrambled out upon the shore,
waddled to her nest, and settled herself once more
to the task of brooding her two big gray-green,
brown-blotched eggs. It was the first week in
June, and the eggs were near hatching.</p>
<p>The pair of loons were restless and annoyed.
Their lake, set in a lonely valley, which was
drained by a branch of the Upper Quah-Davic,
had seemed to them the perfection of solitude
and remoteness. For three years now they had
been coming to it every spring with the first of
the northern flight. But this spring their solitude
had been invaded. A pioneer, a squatter, with a
buxom wife and several noisy children, had come
and built a cabin on the shore of the lake. To
be sure, the lake was large enough to overlook
and forget such a small invasion, but for the
loons it was a great matter. That cabin, those
voices, and laughter, and axe-strokes, and sometimes
gun-shots, though almost a mile away from
their nesting-place, were a detestable and unpardonable
intrusion.</p>
<p>The loon was just about to resume his fishing&mdash;a
business which, on account of his phenomenal
appetite, took up most of his time&mdash;when once
<span class="pb" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
more a movement in the bushes caught his
vigilant eye. At the same instant a flash of
white fire jetted through the leafy screen, a vicious
report rang out, and a shower of shot cut the
water into spurting streaks all about him. But
he was not there. Inconceivably swift, he had
dived at the flash itself. The lead that would
have riddled him struck the empty swirl where
he had vanished. A lanky youth with a gun
stepped out from behind the bushes, stared in
sulky disappointment, and presently strolled off
down the shore to look for less elusive game.</p>
<p>The shattered calm of the lake surface had
time to rebuild itself before the loon reappeared.
A hundred yards away from the spot where he
had dived, his head thrust itself above the water,
a tiny black speck on the silvery sheen. It
disappeared again instantly. When it once more
came to the surface, it was so far out from shore
that its owner felt safe. After a few moments
devoted to inspection of the hunter&rsquo;s retreating
form, the loon arose completely and sent a long
derisive peal of his wild laughter echoing down
the lake. The lanky youth turned and shook
his fist at him, as if threatening to settle the score
at a later day.</p>
<p>The loon had come by this time to a part of
the lake where the depth was not more than six
<span class="pb" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
or seven feet, and the bottom was of rich firm
mud, covered with rank growths. Here and
there a solitary lily-plant, a stray from the
creamy-blossomed, nectar-breathing colony over
in the near-by cove, lifted to the surface its long
pipe-like stems and flat sliding disks of leaves.
It was a favorite resort, this, of almost every
kind of fish that inhabited the lake, except, of
course, of the minnows and other little fry, who
would have been promptly made to serve as food
for their bigger kinsmen had they ventured into
so fatal a neighborhood.</p>
<p>Floating tranquilly, the loon caught sight of
the silvery sides of a fat chub, balancing just
above the bottom, beside one of the slender pipes
of lily-stalk. The fish was lazily opening and
closing its crimson gills, indifferent and with a
well-fed air. It hung at a depth of perhaps
six feet, and at a distance of perhaps sixteen
or twenty. So smoothly as scarcely to leave
a swirl on the surface, the loon dived straight
down, then darted for the fish at a terrific
pace. His powerful feet, folding up and opening
out at each lightning-swift stroke, propelled
him like a torpedo just shot from tube, and
tiny bubbles, formed by the air caught under his
feathers, flicked upward along his course.</p>
<p>The chub caught sight of this shape of doom
<span class="pb" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
rushing upon him through the golden tremor of
the water. He shot off in a panic, seeking some
deep crevice or some weed-thicket dense enough
to hide him. But the loon was almost at his tail.
There was no crevice to be found, and the weed
thickets were too sparse and open to conceal him.
This way and that he darted, doubling and twisting
frantically around every stalk or stone. But
in spite of his bulk, the loon followed each turn
with the agility of an eel. The loosed silt boiled
up in wreaths behind his violent passage, and the
weeds swayed in the wake of the thrusting webs.
In less than a minute the chase&mdash;the turmoil of
which drove every other fish, large or small, in
terror from the feeding-ground&mdash;came suddenly
to an end. Rising abruptly with the fish gripped
in his great beak, the loon burst out upon the
surface, sending shoreward a succession of circling
ripples. Without ceremony he gulped his meal.
Then, swimming rather low in the water, and
with head thrust out before him, he hurried to
his nesting-place on the islet, as if he thought he
had been too long away from his domestic duties.</p>
<p>The spot on the islet where the loons had
their nest was almost unconcealed. It was in
a grassy cup within four or five feet of the
water&rsquo;s edge, and sheltered only by a thin
screen of bushes on the landward side. Toward
<span class="pb" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
the sky it was quite open. There had
seemed to be little need of concealment before
the intruder, man, came to the lake. The
islet was too far from the main shore to be in
danger from the visits of foxes or bears, fishers
or raccoons. And as for the sky&mdash;well, the
loon had little fear of anything that flew. Because
of this lack of apprehension from skyward,
even his coloring was not very protective,
his glossy black, barred and mottled
with pure white, being fairly conspicuous
against the grays, and greens, and browns
which surrounded the nest. Neither he nor
his mate had any particular objection to being
seen by any marauder of the air. Even the
murderous goshawk, or the smaller but even
more fearless duck-hawk, would know better
than to swoop down upon the uplifted dagger
of a nesting loon. And as for the eagle,
though doubtless strong enough to master
such an antagonist in the end, he is wise
enough to know that the loon&rsquo;s punishing
beak and bulldog courage in defence of the
nest would make the victory an expensive
and painful one.</p>
<p>But there was one enemy besides man
whom the loons had cause to fear, even on
their secluded islet. They hated the mink
<span class="pb" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
with a well-founded hate. He could easily
swim out to discover and rob their nest; and
if he should find it for a moment unguarded,
his agility would enable him to keep well
clear of their avenging wrath. On the nest
neither male nor female feared to meet the
mink&rsquo;s attack, their lithe necks and unerring
quickness of thrust being sufficient defence
even against so formidable a robber. But
their movements on land&mdash;an awkward, flopping
series of waddles&mdash;were so slow that,
in the case of a mink arriving, the precious
eggs would be safe only while actually covered.
A big mink had been seen that very morning,
prowling down the opposite shore, and both
birds were uneasy. They seemed now to be
taking counsel upon that or some other equally
important matter.</p>
<p>For the next few days, however, the life
of the loons was tranquil, with good fishing
to content their appetites and no untoward
event to make them anxious. Then came a
day when the patient mother on her nest
could not conceal her happiness and her
excitement, when the male, forgetful of meals,
stood for hours at a time in interested expectancy
beside the nest. The strong chicks
within the eggs were beginning to stir and
<span class="pb" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
chip the shell. It was not the day that the
big mink should have chosen for his expedition
to the islet.</p>
<p>For several weeks the mink had been on the
point of swimming out to explore that little patch
of rocks and grass and bushes, sentinelled by one
dark fir-tree. Such a secluded spot, out of reach
of most forest prowlers, might well afford something
special in the way of good hunting. Hitherto
one thing or another had always diverted him from
his purpose, and he had gone off on another trail.
But to-day nothing intervened. His long, lithe,
black body curving like a snake&rsquo;s, he ran down
the bank, lifted his triangular vicious-looking head
for a survey of the lake, and plunged into the
water with a low splash.</p>
<p>Now, the vision of the mink, though sharp
enough at close quarters, has nothing like the
power and penetration of the loon&rsquo;s. The mink
could see the islet, the rocks, the bushes, the
sentinel fir-tree, but he could not make out the
figure of the loon standing beside the nest. The
loon, on the other hand, could see him with
absolute distinctness, as if not more than fifty feet
away.</p>
<p>As has been already noted, the day was not well
chosen for the mink&rsquo;s trip to the islet. The loon
stiffened himself with anger, and his round bright
<span class="pb" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
eyes hardened implacably. The mother settled
down closer over the stirring eggs, and turned her
head to stare malevolently at the long pointed
trail which the swimmer&rsquo;s head was drawing on the
lake surface. Her mate stood for some seconds
as motionless as a charred stump. Then, slipping
noiselessly down the bank, he glided into the
water and dived from sight.</p>
<p>The lake was deep at this point, the main channel
of the stream&mdash;upon which the lake was
threaded like a great oval bead on a slender string&mdash;running
between the islet and the mainland.
The loon plunged nearly to the bottom, that he
might run no risk of being detected by the enemy.
More than ever like a torpedo, as he pierced the
brown depths, he darted forward to the attack.
Two or three great lake trout, seeing the approach
of the black rushing shape, made way in terror
and hid in the deepest weed-patch they could find.
But the loon was not thinking of fish. The
most tempting tit-bit in the lake at that moment
might have brushed against his feathers with
impunity.</p>
<p>At last, still far ahead of him, he saw the enemy&rsquo;s
approach. As he looked upward through
the water, the under surface was like a radiant but
half transparent mirror, on which the tiniest floating
object, even a fly or a wild-cherry petal, stood
<span class="pb" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
out with amazing distinctness. The dark body
of the swimming mink was large and black and
menacing against its setting of silver, and the
ripples spread away from his chin, ever widening,
till they faded on the shore behind him. The
loon kept straight on till the mink was almost
above him, then he turned and shot upward.</p>
<p>Thinking, doubtless, of some wild duck&rsquo;s nest,
well filled with large green eggs, which he would
devour at his ease after sucking the blood of the
brooding mother, the mink swam on steadily toward
the islet. The worn gray rocks and fringing
grass grew nearer, and the details began to separate
themselves to his fierce little eyes. Presently
he made out the black shape of the female loon
sitting on her nest and eying him. That promised
something interesting. The blood leaped
in his veins, and he raced forward at redoubled
speed, for the mink goes into his frays with a
rampant blood-lust that makes him always formidable,
even to creatures of twice his weight.</p>
<p>It was just at this moment that his alert senses
took note of a strange vague heaving in the water
beneath him, a sort of dull and broad vibration.
Swiftly he ducked his head, to see if the whole
lake-bottom was rising up at him. But he had
no time to see anything. It was as if a red-hot
iron was jabbed straight upward through the
<span class="pb" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
tender back part of his throat, and a swarm of
stars exploded in his brain. Then he knew nothing
more. The loon&rsquo;s steel-like bill had pierced
to and penetrated the base of the skull, and with
one convulsive kick, the robber&rsquo;s body straightened
itself out upon the water. Shaking his head
like an angry terrier, he wrenched his bill free
and hurried back to reassure his mate, leaving
the body of the mink to sink languidly to the
bottom. Here, among the weeds, it was presently
discovered by the eels and crawfish, faithful
scavengers, who saw to it that there should be
nothing left to pollute the sweet lake-waters.</p>
<p>On the following day the two awkward, dingy-hued,
downy chicks were hatched, and thenceforth
the parents were kept busy supplying their extremely
healthy appetites. The havoc wrought
among the finny hordes&mdash;the trout and &ldquo;togue&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a>
and chub, the red-fins, shiners, and minnows&mdash;was
enormous. The loon chicks, enterprising
and industrious, speedily learned to help their
parents by hunting the small fry in the sunlit
shallows along shore.</p>
<p>But the loon family were not the only ardent
fishermen on those waters. The new-comers,
<span class="pb" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
the man family, they too liked fish, and had no
mean skill in catching them. In fact, their methods
were stupidly and slaughterously destructive, well
calculated to quite draw out the lake in two or
three seasons. They set a big purse-seine right
across the channel, and, worst of all, they dragged
the deep dark pools, wherein, now that the waters
were growing warmer under the mid-June sun,
the biggest trout and &ldquo;togue&rdquo; were wont to
gather for coolness. Their own thought was to
get their larder well stocked with salted fish
against the coming winter. Future winters might
look out for themselves.</p>
<p>For some time the great loon, though more
enterprising and wide-ranging than his prudent
mate, had kept careful distance from the nets
and net-stakes, as from all the other visible manifestations
of man. But at last he grew accustomed
to the tall immovable stakes in the channel which
supported the purse-seine. He concluded that
they were harmless, or even impotent, and decided
to investigate them.</p>
<p>As he approached, the dim meshes of the net,
shimmering vaguely in the bright water, excited
his suspicions. He sheered off warily and swam
around the seine at a prudent distance. At last
he found the opening. There seemed to be no
danger anywhere in sight, so, after some hesitation,
<span class="pb" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
he sailed in. The ordered curving rows of the
stakes, the top line of the net, beaded with a few
floats, here and there rising above the water&mdash;it
was all very curious, but it did not seem in any
way hostile. He eyed it scornfully. For what
was neither dangerous nor useful he had a highly
practical contempt. Having satisfied his curiosity,
and allayed a certain uneasiness with which he
had always regarded the great set-net, he turned
to swim out again. But at this moment he chanced
to look down.</p>
<p>The sight that met his eyes was one to stir the
blood of any fisherman. He was just over the
&ldquo;purse&rdquo;&mdash;that fatal chamber whence so few who
enter it ever find the exit. The narrow space was
crowded with every kind of fish that frequented
the lake, except for the slim eels and the small
fry who could swim through the meshes. It was
the chance of a loon&rsquo;s lifetime. Flashing downward,
he darted this way and that ecstatically among
the frantic prisoners, transfixing half a dozen in
succession, to make sure of them, before he seized
a big trout for his immediate meal. Gripping the
victim savagely in his bill, he slanted toward the
surface, and plunged into a slack bight of the net.</p>
<p>Luckily for him, he was within a foot of the
air before he struck the deceitful meshes. Carried
on by the impetus of his rush, he bore the net
<span class="pb" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
upward with him, and emerged into the full sun.
In the shock of his surprise he dropped the fish,
and at the same time gulped his lungs full of
fresh air. For perhaps half a minute, he thrust
and flapped and tore furiously, expecting to break
through the elusive obstacle, which yielded so
freely that he could get no hold upon it, yet
always thrust him back with a suave but inexorable
persistence. At length, realizing himself
foiled in this direction, he sank downward like a
stone, thinking to back out of the struggle and
rise somewhere else. But, to his horror, the
bight of the net came down with him, refusing to
be left. In his struggles he had completely enmeshed
himself.</p>
<p>And now, probably for the very first time in a
not uneventful life, the great loon lost his head.
He began to fight blindly, overwhelmed by panic
terror. Plunging, kicking, beating with half-fettered
wings, striking with his beak in a semi-paralyzed
fashion because he had not room to
stretch his neck to its full length, he was soon
utterly exhausted. Moreover, he was more than
half drowned. At last, a dimness coming over the
golden amber light, he gave up in despair. With
a feeble despairing stroke of his webbed feet, he
strove to get back to the surface. Happily for
him, the net in this direction was not relentless.
<span class="pb" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
It yielded without too much resistance, and the
hopelessly entangled prisoner came to the top.
Lying there in the meshes, he could at least draw
breath.</p>
<p>When, a little later in the day, he saw a boat
approaching up the lake with two of the dreaded
man creatures in it, he gave one final mighty
struggle, which lashed the water into foam and
sent the imprisoned fish into fresh paroxysms;
and then, with the stoicism which some of the
wild creatures can display in the moment of supreme
and hopeless peril, he lay quite still, eying
the foe defiantly.</p>
<p>One of the beings in the boat was that lanky
youth whose attempt to shoot the loon had been
such a conspicuous failure. The other was the
lanky youth&rsquo;s father, the pioneer himself. At
the sight of the trussed-up captive, the youth
shouted exultantly&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s that durn loon what&rsquo;s eatin&rsquo; all the fish
in the lake! I&rsquo;ll fix his fishin&rsquo;!&rdquo; and, lifting
his oar from the thole-pins, he raised it to strike
the helpless bird.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be sich a <i>durn</i> fool, Zeb!&rdquo; interrupted
the father. &ldquo;Ye&rsquo;ll get more money for that bird
alive, down to Fredericton, than all the fish in
the net&rsquo;s worth. A loon like that ain&rsquo;t common.
He&rsquo;s a beauty!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">[170]</div>
<p>The youth dropped his oar and leaned over to
snatch up the prize. But he jumped back with
alacrity as his father snapped: &ldquo;<i>Look out!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What for?&rdquo; he demanded, rather sheepishly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; replied the older man, &ldquo;he&rsquo;ll stick
you like a pig with that knife beak of his&rsquo;n, if ye
don&rsquo;t look sharp! Reach me yer jacket. We&rsquo;ll
wrap up his head till we kin get him clear o&rsquo; the
net.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The youth obeyed. Helplessly swathed in
the heavy homespun jacket, whose strong man
smell enraged and daunted him, the great bird
was disentangled from the net and lifted into the
boat. Laughingly the father passed the bundle
along the gunwale to his son.</p>
<p>But swathing a powerful bird in a jacket is a
more or less inexact undertaking, as many have
found in experimenting with wounded hawks and
eagles. By some lucky wriggle the loon got his
head free. Instantly, with all the force of his
powerful neck-muscles, he drove his beak half-way
through the fleshy part of his old enemy&rsquo;s
arm. With a startled yell the lad dropped him.
He bounded from the gunwale and rolled into
the water. The man snatched at him and caught
a flopping sleeve of the jacket. The jacket
promptly and neatly unrolled, and the loon, diving
deep, was out of sight in an eye-wink, leaving
<span class="pb" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
his would-be jailers to express themselves according
to their mood. When he came to the surface
for breath, he was a hundred yards away, and on
the other side of the boat, and as he thrust little
more than his beak and nostrils above water, he
was not detected.</p>
<p>A few minutes more, and he was laughing
derisively from the other side of the islet, swimming
in safety with his mate and his two energetic
chicks. Nevertheless, for all his triumph and
the discomfiture of his foes, the grim experience
had put him out of conceit with the lake. That
same night, when the white moon rode high over
the jagged spruce ridges, a hollow globe of enchantment,
he led his little family straight up the
river, mile after mile, till they reached another
lake. It was a small lake, shut in by brooding
hills, with iron shores, and few fish in its inhospitable
waters, but it was remote from man and his
works. So here the outraged bird was content
to establish himself till the hour should return for
migrants to fly south.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">[173]</div>
<h2 id="c10">HOW A CAT PLAYED ROBINSON CRUSOE</h2>
<p>The island was a mere sandbank off the
low flat coast. Not a tree broke its bleak
levels, not even a shrub. But the long, sparse,
gritty stalks of the marsh-grass clothed it everywhere
above tide-mark, and a tiny rivulet of
sweet water, flowing from a spring at its centre,
drew a riband of inland herbage and tenderer
green across the harsh and sombre yellow-gray
of the grass. One would not have chosen the
island as an alluring place to set one&rsquo;s habitation,
yet at its seaward end, where the changing tides
were never still, stood a spacious, one-storied,
wide-verandahed cottage, with a low shed behind
it. The one virtue that this lone plot of sea-rejected
sand could boast was coolness. When
the neighbor mainland would be sweltering,
day and night alike, under a breathless heat,
out here on the island there was always a cool
wind blowing. Therefore a wise city dweller
had appropriated the sea waif, and built his
summer home thereon, where the tonic airs might
<span class="pb" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
bring back the rose to the pale cheeks of his
children.</p>
<p>The family came to the island toward the
end of June. In the first week of September
they went away, leaving every door and window
of house and shed securely shuttered, bolted or
barred, against the winter&rsquo;s storms. A roomy
boat, rowed by two fishermen, carried them
across the half mile of racing tides that separated
them from the mainland. The elders of the
household were not sorry to get back to the
distractions of the world of men, after two months
of the companionship of wind and sun and waves
and waving grass-tops. But the children went
with tear-stained faces. They were leaving behind
them their household pet, the invariable
comrade of their migrations, a handsome moon-faced
cat, striped like a tiger. The animal had
disappeared two days before, vanishing mysteriously
from the naked face of the island. The
only reasonable explanation seemed to be that
she had been snapped up by a passing eagle.</p>
<p>The cat, meanwhile, was fast prisoner at the
other end of the island, hidden beneath a broken
barrel and some hundredweight of drifted sand.</p>
<p>The old barrel, with the staves battered out
on one side in some past encounter with the
tides, had stood half buried on the crest of a
<span class="pb" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
sand-ridge raised by the long prevailing wind.
Under its lee the cat had found a sheltered
hollow, full of sun, where she had been wont to
lie curled up for hours at a time, basking and
sleeping. Meanwhile, the sand had been steadily
piling itself higher and higher behind the unstable
barrier. At last, it had piled too high,
and suddenly, before a stronger gust, the barrel
had come toppling over beneath a mass of sand,
burying the sleeping cat out of sight and light;
but at the same time the sound half of the barrel
had formed a safe roof to her prison, and she
was neither crushed nor smothered. When the
children, in their anxious search all over the
island, came upon the mound of fine white sand,
they gave it but one careless look. They could
not hear the faint cries that came at intervals
from the close darkness within. So they went
away sorrowfully, little dreaming that their friend
was imprisoned almost beneath their feet.</p>
<p>For three days the prisoner kept up her intermittent
appeals for help. On the third day the
wind changed, and presently blew up a gale. In
a few hours it had uncovered the barrel. At one
corner a tiny spot of light appeared. Eagerly
the cat stuck her paw through the hole. When
she withdrew it again, the hole was considerably
enlarged. She took the hint, and fell to scratching.
<span class="pb" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
At first her efforts were rather aimless; but
presently, whether by good luck or quick sagacity,
she learned to make her scratching more effective.
The opening rapidly enlarged, and she squeezed
her way out.</p>
<p>The wind was tearing madly across the island,
filled with flying sand. The seas hurled themselves
trampling up the beach, with the uproar of
a bombardment. The scourged grasses lay pallid,
bowed flat in long quivering ranks. Over the
turmoil the sun stared down from a deep unclouded
blue. The cat, when she first met the full force
of the gale, was fairly blown off her feet. As soon
as she could recover herself, she crouched low and
darted into the grass for shelter. But there was
little shelter there, the long stalks being held down
almost level as if by an implacable hand. Through
their lashed lines, however, she sped straight before
the gale, making for the cottage at the other
end of the island, where she would find, as she
fondly imagined, not only food and shelter, but
loving comfort to make her forget her terrors.</p>
<p>Unutterably still and desolate in the bright
sunshine, and under the howling of the wind, the
house frightened her. She could not understand
the tight-closed shutters, the blind unresponding
doors that would no longer open to her anxious
appeal. The wind swept her savagely across the
<span class="pb" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
naked veranda. Climbing with difficulty to the
dining-room window-sill, where so often she had
been let in, she clung there a few moments and
yowled heart-brokenly. Then, in a sudden panic,
she jumped down and ran to the shed. That, too,
was closed. She had never seen the shed doors
closed, and could not understand it. Cautiously
she crept around the foundations, but those had
been honestly and efficiently constructed. There
was no such thing as getting in that way. On
every side it was nothing but a dead face, dead
and forbidding, that the old familiar house confronted
her with.</p>
<p>The cat had always been so coddled and pampered
by the children that she had had no need
to forage for herself; but, fortunately for her now,
she had learned to hunt the marsh-mice and grass-sparrows
for amusement. So now, being ravenous
from her long fast under the sand, she slunk
mournfully away from the deserted house, and
crept along, under the lee of a sand-ridge, to a
little grassy hollow which she knew. Here the
gale caught only the tops of the grasses, bending
but not prostrating them; and here in the
warmth and comparative calm, the furry little
marsh-folk, mice and shrews, were going about
their business undisturbed. The cat, quick and
stealthy, soon caught one, and eased the ferocity
<span class="pb" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
of her hunger. She caught several. And then,
making her way back to the house, she spent
hours in heart-sick prowling, around it and around,
sniffing and peering, yowling piteously on threshold
and window-sill, and every now and then being
blown ignominiously across the smooth naked
expanse of the veranda floor. At last, hopelessly
discouraged, she curled herself up out of the wind,
beneath the children&rsquo;s window, and went to sleep.</p>
<p>On the following day the gale died down, and
the salt-grass once more lifted its tops, full of flitting
birds and small brown-and-yellow autumn
butterflies, under the golden September sun.
Desolate though the island was, it swarmed, nevertheless,
with the minute busy life of the grass-stems
and the sand-flats. Mice, crickets, sand-hoppers&mdash;the
cat had no need to go hungry
or unoccupied. She went all over house and
shed again, from foundation to roof and chimney-top,
yowling from time to time in a great hollow,
melancholy voice that might have been heard all
across the island had there been any one to hear,
and again, from time to time, meowing in small
piteous tones no bigger than a kitten&rsquo;s. For hours
at a time when hunger did not drive her to the
hunt, she would sit expectant on the window-ledge,
or before the door, or on the veranda steps,
hoping that at any instant door or window might
<span class="pb" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
open, and dear familiar voices call her in. When
she did go hunting, she hunted with peculiar
ferocity, as if to avenge herself for some great but
dimly apprehended wrong.</p>
<p>In spite of her loneliness and grief, the life of
the island prisoner during the next two or three
weeks was by no means one of hardship. Besides
her abundant food of birds and mice, she quickly
learned to catch tiny fish in the mouth of the rivulet,
where salt water and fresh water met. It was
an exciting game, and she became expert at dashing
the gray tour-cod and blue-and-silver sand-lance
far up the slope with a sweep of her armed paw.
But when the equinoctial storms roared down upon
the island, with furious rain and low black clouds
torn to shreds, then life became more difficult for
her. Game all took to cover, where it was hard
to find&mdash;vanishing mysteriously. It was hard
to get around in the drenched and lashing grass,
and, moreover, she loathed wet. Most of the
time she went hungry, sitting sullen and desolate
under the lee of the house, glaring out defiantly
at the rush and battling tumult of the waves.</p>
<p>The storm lasted nearly ten days before it blew
itself clean out. On the eighth day the abandoned
wreck of a small Nova Scotia schooner drove
ashore, battered out of all likeness to a ship. But,
hulk as it was, it had passengers of a sort. A
<span class="pb" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
horde of bedraggled rats got through the surf and
scurried into the hiding of the grass-roots. They
promptly made themselves at home, burrowing
under the grass and beneath old half-buried
timbers, and carrying panic into the ranks of the
mice and shrews. When the storm was over, the
cat had a decided surprise in her first long hunting
expedition. Something had rustled the grass
heavily, and she trailed it, expecting a particularly
large fat marsh-mouse. When she pounced and
alighted upon an immense old ship&rsquo;s rat, many-voyaged
and many-battled, she got badly bitten.
Such an experience had never before fallen to her
lot. At first she felt so injured that she was on the
point of backing out and running away. Then
her latent pugnacity awoke, and the fire of far-off
ancestors. She flung herself into the fight with a
rage that took no accounting of the wounds she got,
and the struggle was soon over. Hungry though
she was, she dragged the slain rat all the way to
the house, and laid it proudly on the veranda
floor before the door, as if displaying it to the
eyes of her vanished friends. For a few moments
she stood over it, waiting hopefully. Perhaps
she had a wistful idea that so splendid an offering
might melt the hearts of the absent ones and persuade
them to come back. Nothing happened,
however, so she sadly dragged the prize down the
<span class="pb" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
steps again to her accustomed lair in the sand, and
ate it up all but the tail. Her wounds, faithfully
licked, soon healed themselves in that clean and
tonic air, and after that, having learned how to
handle such big game, she no more got bitten.</p>
<p>During the first full moon after her abandonment,
the first week in October, the island was
visited by still weather, with sharp night frosts.
The cat discovered then that it was most exciting
to hunt by night and do her sleeping in the daytime.
It was a natural reversion to the instincts
of her ancestors, but it came to her as a discovery.
She found that now, under the strange whiteness
of the moon, all her game was astir, except the
birds. And the birds had all fled to the mainland
during the storm, gathering for the southward
flight. The blanched grasses, she found,
were now everywhere a-rustle, and everywhere
vague, spectral, little shapes went darting, with
thin squeaks, across the ghostly white sands.
Also, she made the aquaintance of a new bird,
which she regarded at first uneasily, and then with
vengeful wrath. This was the brown marsh-owl,
which came over from the mainland to do some
autumn mouse-hunting. There were two pairs
of these big, downy-winged, round-eyed, voracious
hunters, and they did not know there was a
cat on the island.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">[184]</div>
<p>The cat, spying one of them as it swooped
soundlessly hither and thither over the silvered
grass-tops, crouched with flattened ears. With
its wide spread of wing it looked bigger than herself,
and the great round face, with hooked beak
and wild staring eyes, appeared extremely formidable.
However, she was no coward, and presently,
though not without reasonable caution, she went
about her hunting. Suddenly the owl caught a
partial glimpse of her in the grass, probably of
her ears or head. He swooped, and at the same
instant she sprang upward to meet the assault,
spitting and growling harshly, and striking with
unsheathed claws. With a frantic flapping of his
great wings, the owl checked himself and drew
back into the air, just escaping the clutch of those
indignant claws. But after that the marsh-owls
were careful to give her a wide berth. They
realized that the black-striped animal, with the
quick spring and the clutching claws, was not to be
interfered with. They perceived that she was
some relation of that dangerous prowler, the lynx.
But if they were disturbed by the presence on
the island of so dangerous a rival as the cat, they
were amply compensated by the coming of the
rats, who afforded them fine hunting of a kind
which they had never before experienced. In
spite of all this hunting, however, the furry life
<span class="pb" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
of the marsh-grass was so teeming, so inexhaustible,
that the depredations of cat, rats, and owls were
powerless to make more than a passing impression
upon it. So the hunting and the merrymaking
went on side by side under the indifferent moon,
and the untouched swarms whom Fate passed by
were as indifferent as the moon herself to the
mysterious disappearances of their fellows.</p>
<p>As winter drew on, with bursts of sharp cold
and changing winds that forced her to be continually
changing her refuge, the cat grew more and
more unhappy. She felt her homelessness keenly.
Nowhere on the whole island could she find a
nook where she might feel secure from both wind
and rain. As for the old barrel, the first cause of
her misfortunes, there was no help in that. The
winds had long ago turned it completely over,
open to the sky, then drifted it full of sand and
reburied it. And in any case the cat would have
been afraid to go near it again; she had no short
memory. So it came about that she alone, of all
the island dwellers, had no shelter to turn to
when the real winter arrived, with snows that
smothered the grass-tops out of sight, and frosts
that lined the shore with grinding ice-cakes.
The rats had their holes under the buried fragments
of wreckage; the mice and shrews had
their deep warm tunnels; the owls had nests in
<span class="pb" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
hollow trees far away in the forests of the mainland.
But the cat, shivering and frightened,
could do nothing but crouch against the blind
walls of the unrelenting house, and let the snow
whirl itself and pile itself about her.</p>
<p>And now, in her misery, she found her food
cut off. The mice ran secure in their hidden runways,
where the grass-roots on either side of them
gave them easy and abundant provender. The
rats, too, were out of sight, digging burrows themselves
in the soft snow, in the hope of intercepting
some of the tunnels of the mice, and now and
then snapping up an unwary passer-by. The ice-fringe,
crumbling and heaving under the ruthless
tide, put an end to her fishing. She would have
tried to capture one of the formidable owls, in her
hunger, but the owls no longer came to the island.
They would return, no doubt, later in the season,
when the snow had hardened, and the mice had
begun to come out and play on the surface, but
for the present they were following an easier chase
in the deeps of the upland forest.</p>
<p>When the snow had stopped falling, and the
sun came out again, there fell such keen cold as
the cat had never felt before. Starving as she
was, she could not sleep, but kept ceaselessly on
the prowl. This was fortunate for her, for had
she gone to sleep, without any more shelter than
<span class="pb" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
the side of the house, she would never have
wakened again. In her restlessness she wandered
to the farther side of the island, where, in a somewhat
sheltered and sunny recess of the shore, facing
the mainland, she found a patch of bare sand,
free of ice-cakes and just uncovered by the tide.
Opening upon this recess were the tiny entrances
to several of the mouse-tunnels.</p>
<p>Close beside one of these holes, in the snow, the
cat crouched, quiveringly intent. For ten minutes
or more she waited, never so much as twitching
a whisker. At last a mouse thrust out its
little pointed head. Not daring to give it time
to change its mind or take alarm, she pounced.
The mouse, glimpsing the doom ere it fell,
doubled back upon itself in the narrow runway.
Hardly realizing what she did, in her desperation
the cat plunged head and shoulders into the snow,
reaching blindly after the vanished prize. By
great good luck she clutched it and held it.</p>
<p>It was her first meal in four bitter days.</p>
<p>Now she had learned a lesson. Naturally
clever, and her wits sharpened by her fierce necessities,
she had grasped the idea that it was possible
to follow her prey a little way into the snow.
She had not realized that the snow was so penetrable.
She had quite obliterated the door of
this particular runway, but she went on and
<span class="pb" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
crouched beside another. Here she had to wait
a long time before an adventurous mouse came to
peer out. But this time she showed that she had
grasped her lesson effectively. It was straight at
the side of the entrance that she pounced, where
instinct told her that the body of the mouse would
be. One outstretched paw thus cut off the
quarry&rsquo;s retreat. Her tactics were completely
successful, and as her head went plunging into
the fluffy whiteness, she felt the prize between
her paws.</p>
<p>Her hunger now fairly appeased, she found
herself immensely excited over this new fashion
of hunting. Often before had she waited at
mouse-holes, but never had she found it possible
to break down the walls and invade the holes
themselves. It was a thrilling idea. As she
crept toward another hole, a mouse scurried
swiftly up the sand and darted into it. The cat,
too late to catch him before he disappeared, tried
to follow him. Scratching clumsily but hopefully,
she succeeded in penetrating the full length of
her body into the snow. Of course she found no
sign of the fugitive, which was by this time racing
in safety down some dim transverse tunnel. Her
eyes, mouth, whiskers, and fur full of the powdery
white particles, she backed out, much disappointed.
But in that moment she had realized that it was
<span class="pb" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
much warmer in there beneath the snow than out
in the stinging air. It was a second and vitally
important lesson. And though she was probably
unconscious of having learned it, she instinctively
put the new lore into practice a little while later.
Having succeeded in catching yet another mouse,
for which her appetite made no immediate demand,
she carried it back to the house and laid
it down in tribute on the veranda steps, while
she meowed and stared hopefully at the desolate
snow-draped door. Getting no response, she
carried the dead mouse down with her to the hollow
behind the drift, which had been caused by
the bulging front of the bay-window on the end of
the house. Here she curled herself up forlornly,
thinking to have a wink of sleep.</p>
<p>But the still cold was too searching. She
looked at the sloping wall of snow beside
her, and cautiously thrust her paw into it.
It was very soft and light; it seemed to
offer practically no resistance. She pawed away
in an awkward fashion till she had scooped out
a sort of tiny cave. Gently she pushed herself
into it, pressing back the snow on every
side, till she had room to turn around. Then
turn around she did several times, as so many
dogs do in getting their beds arranged to their
liking. In this process she not only packed
<span class="pb" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
down the snow beneath her, but she rounded out
for herself a snug chamber with a comparatively
narrow doorway. From this snowy retreat she
gazed forth with a solemn air of possession, then
went to sleep with a sense of comfort, of &ldquo;homeyness,&rdquo;
such as she had never before felt since the
disappearance of her friends.</p>
<p>Having thus conquered her environment, and
won herself the freedom of the winter wild, her
life, though strenuous, was no longer one of any
terrible hardship. With patience at the mouse-holes,
she could catch enough to eat, and in her
snowy den she slept warm and secure. In a little
while, when a crust had formed over the surface,
the mice took to coming out at night and holding
revels on the snow. Then the owls, too, came
back, and the cat, having tried to catch one, got
sharply bitten and clawed before she realized the
propriety of letting it go. After this experience
she decided that owls, on the whole, were meant
to be let alone. But, for all that, she found it
fine hunting out there on the bleak, unfenced,
white reaches of the snow.</p>
<p>Thus mistress of the situation, she found the
winter slipping by without further serious trials.
Only once, toward the end of January, did Fate
send her a bad quarter of an hour. On the heels
of a peculiarly bitter cold snap, a huge white owl
<span class="pb" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
from the Arctic barrens came one night to the
island. The cat, taking observations from the
corner of the veranda, caught sight of him. One
look was enough to assure her that this was a
very different kind of visitor from the brown
marsh-owls. She slipped inconspicuously down
into her burrow, and until the great white owl
went away some twenty-four hours later, she
kept herself discreetly out of sight.</p>
<p>When spring came back to the island, with the
nightly shrill chorus of fluting frogs in the shallow
sedgy pools, and the young grass alive with nesting
birds, the prisoner&rsquo;s life became almost luxurious
in its easy abundance. But now she was
once more homeless, since her snug den had
vanished with the snow. This did not matter
much to her now, however, for the weather grew
warmer and more tranquil day by day, and, moreover,
she herself, in being forced back upon long
latent instincts, had learned the heedless vagrancy
of the wild. Nevertheless, with all her capacity
for learning and adapting herself, she had not forgotten
anything. So when, one day in June, a
crowded boat came over from the mainland, and
children&rsquo;s voices, clamoring across the grass-tops,
broke the desolate silence of the island, the cat
heard, and sprang up out of her sleep on the
veranda steps. For one second she stood listening
<span class="pb" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
intently. Then, almost as a dog would have
done, and as few of her supercilious tribe ever
condescend to do, she went racing across to the
landing-place, to be snatched up into the arms of
four happy children at once, and to have her fine
fur ruffled to a state which it would cost her an
hour&rsquo;s assiduous toilet to put in order.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">[193]</div>
<h2 id="c11">LITTLE BULL OF THE BARRENS</h2>
<p>Through the thick drive of the snowflakes&mdash;small,
hard, bitter flakes, borne
on the long wind of the terrible Coppermine barrens&mdash;the
man and the beast stood staring at
each other, motionless. In the beast&rsquo;s eyes was
a heavy wonder, mixed with curiosity and dread.
Never before had he seen any being like this
erect slim shape, veiled and vague and dark in
the whirling drift. He felt it to be dangerous,
but he was loath to tear himself away from the
scrutiny of it.</p>
<p>The man, on the other hand, had neither wonder,
curiosity, nor dread in his gaze. He knew
that the black and massive apparition before him
was a musk-ox. His first impulse had been to
snatch up his rifle and shoot, before the beast
could fade off into the white confusion of the
storm. But his practised eye had told him that
the animal was an old bull. His necessity was
not fierce enough to drive him to the eating of
such flesh&mdash;tough and reeking to nausea with
musk. He wanted a young cow whose meat
would be tender and sweet as caribou. He was
<span class="pb" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
content to wait, knowing that the herd must be
near, and would not leave these feeding-grounds
unless frightened. At this season the black bull,
there staring at him heavily through the drift,
would not be solitary.</p>
<p>The man was a trapper, who was making his
way down the river to the Hudson Bay Company&rsquo;s
post at the mouth. Through failure of
the caribou to come his way according to their
custom, his supplies had run short, and he was
seeking the post in good time before the pinch of
hunger should fix itself upon him. But he had
had bad luck. The failure of the caribou had hit
others besides himself. The wolves had suffered
by it. Perhaps, in their shrewd and savage
spirits, they had blamed the man for the absence
of their accustomed quarry. Some weeks
before his start they had craftily picked off his
dogs&mdash;a reasonable and satisfying retaliation.
And now the man was hauling the sledge himself.</p>
<p>In a moment&rsquo;s lift of the storm, the man had
noted a little valley, a depression in the vast wind-swept
level of the barrens, lying but a couple of
stone&rsquo;s-throws aside from the banks of the river
which was his guide. He knew that there he
would find a dense growth of the stunted firs
which spring up wherever they can find shelter
from the wind. There he knew he would find
<span class="pb" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
dry stuff in plenty for his fire. There he would
take covert till the storm should go down and
suffer him to trail the musk-ox herd. After eying
the black bull steadily for some minutes, he
softly turned away, and without haste made for
the valley of the little firs, dragging the laden
sledge behind him.</p>
<p>The black bull snorted thickly and took several
steps forward. The strange figure fading
silently away through the drift evidently feared
him. A fleeing foe was surely to be followed.
But that long dark shape crawling at the stranger&rsquo;s
heels&mdash;<i>that</i> looked formidable and very mysterious.
The beast stopped, shook his head, snorted
again more loudly, and drew back those few paces
which he had advanced. Perhaps it was just as
well not to be too bold in interrogating the unknown.
After a few moments of hesitation he
wheeled aside, lifted his massive and shaggy head,
sniffed the air, listened intently, and withdrew to
rejoin the little herd, which was lying down and
contentedly chewing the cud, all indifferent to the
drive of the polar storm.</p>
<p>The black bull of the barrens, as he stood and
eyed contemplatively the resting herd, showed
small in stature but extraordinarily massive in
build. A scant six feet in length from muzzle to
root of tail, and not much over three feet high at
<span class="pb" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
the shoulder, he was modelled, nevertheless, on
lines that for power a mammoth might have
envied. His square frame was clothed with long
blackish hair reaching almost to the fetlocks.
His ponderous head, maned and shaggy, was
armed with short crescent horns, keen-tipped and
serviceable for battle. And he carried it swung
low, muzzle in and front well forward, always
ready for defence against the enemies of the
herd.</p>
<p>The herd numbered some dozen or fifteen
cows, armed and powerful like their mates, several
younger bulls, and perhaps a dozen yearling or
two-year-old calves. At one moment, as the
fierce drift slackened, they would all be more or
less visible&mdash;shrouded, dark forms with contemplative
eyes, peacefully ruminating. A moment
more and they would vanish, as the snow
again closed down about them.</p>
<p>It was the old bull alone who seemed to be
thoroughly on the alert. Hither and thither,
with a certain slow vigilance, he moved through
the herd. All at once he lifted his head sharply
and questioned the air with dilating nostrils, while
his eyes gleamed with anger and anxiety. The
next instant he stamped his foot and gave a loud
abrupt call, half bleat, half bellow.</p>
<p>Plainly it was a signal well understood. In a
<span class="pb" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
second the whole herd was on its feet. In another,
with lightning precision, it had formed itself into
a compact circle, using the watchful leader as the
basic point of its formation. The calves, butted
unceremoniously into the centre, hustled one upon
the other, with uplifted muzzles over each other&rsquo;s
shoulders and mild eyes staring with startled fright.
The outer rim of the circle became a fringe of
sullen lowering foreheads, angry eyes and keen
horns jutting formidably from snow-powdered
manes of dark hair.</p>
<p>Not a member of the musk-ox herd, to the
youngest calf, but knew very well against what
enemy the old bull had so suddenly marshalled
them into fighting phalanx. For some moments,
however&mdash;long, tense, vigilant moments&mdash;nothing
appeared. Then at last, through the
driving flakes, they caught sight of several gaunt,
leaping forms, gray and shadowy, which swept
down upon them in silence out of the storm.</p>
<p>With terrible suddenness and speed they came,
these leaping forms, as if they would hurl themselves
blindly upon the massed herd. But the
line of lowered horns never flinched or wavered,
and with a short snarl from their leader the wolves
swerved, just in time to escape a savage thrust
from the old bull. They swerved, strung out
into line, and went loping round the circle, their
<span class="pb" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
narrowed, greenish, merciless eyes glaring into the
obstinate ones of the musk-oxen. Again and
again they circled the rampart of horns, again and
again they drew off and swept up furiously to the
assault, hoping to find some weak point in the
defences&mdash;some timorous young cow who would
shrink and swerve at their assault and open a
breach in the line. But there was no cow in that
herd afflicted with any such suicidal folly. The
snow-spotted, lowering line of heads waited unshaken,
and presently the wolves&mdash;there were
seven of them&mdash;bunched together a few paces
from the circle and seemed to consider. Two of
them sat down upon their haunches with their
tongues hanging out, and eyed the rampart of
horned fronts evilly, while the others stood with
their heads together, or prowled restlessly back
and forth. They might, indeed, with the vast
leaping power of their long legs and muscular
haunches, have sprung clear over the line of defence,
and gained in two seconds the helpless calves in
the centre; but they knew what that would mean.
The herd would turn in upon them in a blind,
uncalculating fury and trample them underfoot.
For the moment, therefore, they hung wavering
in irresolution, looking for a sign from the
leader of the pack.</p>
<p>In the meantime the man had found his valley
<span class="pb" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
hollow and the shelter of the expected colony of
dwarf firs. Here the snow lay soft and undrifted.
In a recess of the fir-thicket he trod it down with
his snowshoes, and made haste to build himself
a little fire of dead sticks. Above his head, above
the shrouded fir-tops, above the rim of the hollow,
the storm drove by unabated; but the
snowflakes that escaped from the tumult to filter
down into this retreat were too light and fine and
dry to interfere with the fire. In two or three
minutes the flames were crackling up clear and
free, with little spittings and fine hissings where
the flakes fell at their thin edges.</p>
<p>Having collected a pile of dry sticks within
easy reach, the man stretched a couple of stitched
caribou hides on poles to form a sloping roof
over his head, cooked himself a hasty stew of
pemmican and biscuit, made a hearty meal, and
squatted before the fire with his back against his
sledge, to smoke and wait. He knew how to
wait, like an Indian, when there was anything to
be gained by it, and his heart, weary of pemmican,
was set on fresh meat.</p>
<p>There was no sign of the storm breaking;
there was no use hunting in the storm. There
was nothing to fear, for it was now three weeks
since he had seen sign of the wolves which had
eaten his dogs, and he knew that they had ranged
<span class="pb" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
off on the trail of the vanished caribou. There was
nothing to do. He was warm and filled, and free
from care. Some hundred miles or so away there
was a post and human companionship, to which he
looked forward with unhurried content. In due
time he would arrive there and find it, as always
before, unchanged, like all else in that land of
inevitable recurrence. Meanwhile&mdash;this afternoon,
perhaps, or to-morrow&mdash;he would shoot
a young musk-ox cow. He drew his furs well
about him and dozed off to sleep, knowing that
the moment the fire began to get dangerously low
an unfailing instinct would bid him awake to
tend it.</p>
<p>While he slept, the storm drove unrelenting
over the place of his retreat, and kept heaping the
thin dry snow in fringes and wreaths upon the
shaggy, lowering fronts of the musk-ox phalanx.
From time to time, a massive head would shake
off the burden and emerge black and menacing.
And always, with unwavering vigilance, the army
of angry eyes and short sharp horns confronted
the group of discontented wolves.</p>
<p>Now, as it chanced, the trapper was wrong in
his assumption as to the wolves. The truth&mdash;which
would have made a great difference in his
calculations had he known it&mdash;was that they had
been cautiously trailing him ever since he left his
<span class="pb" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
hut. But they knew something of man, those
wolves, and they feared him. They were not yet
quite mad with hunger, so they had not yet quite
plucked up courage to reveal themselves to him,
still less to commit themselves to an open attack.
They dreaded his eye, they dreaded his sharp,
authoritative voice. They dreaded the strange,
menacing smell of him. They dreaded his mysterious
power of striking invisibly from very far
off. Had they had any choice, they would far
rather have been running down the caribou than
trailing this solitary trapper. But the craving
belly is a hard master, and they had no choice but
to hasten wherever it scourged them on. Moreover,
they knew along the trail of the man there
were liable to be pickings, for man, a fastidious
feeder, never eats all he kills.</p>
<p>When at last the trail of the man had led them
into that of the musk-oxen, the pack had been
glad. So much the more, therefore, their disappointed
rage, when they found the herd ready for
their attack, and too strong, in point of numbers
and experienced leadership, to be stampeded.
Seeing the prey so near, with each moment of
their discomfiture their hunger and their fury
grew.</p>
<p>Suddenly, without visible sign or warning, it
seemed to boil over all at once. The whole
<span class="pb" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
pack sprang together, swift as the snap of a whip,
into a compact mass, and hurled itself straight
upon the circle of lowered horns. The charge
looked irresistible. It seemed that the most
dauntless must cringe and shrink before it.</p>
<p>But the point attacked was a strong one in the
array. It was held by the wise old bull. To
either side of him the shaggy black heads breathed
hard or snorted loudly, but not a horn wavered.
And in the face of this steadfastness the attack
was not driven home. In the very last fraction
of a second the leader swerved; the pack swept
swiftly aside, but it was very close. As the hindmost
wolf went by, the old bull lunged forward,
head and shoulders beyond the circle, with a savage
twist of his short, polished horns. There
was a startled yelp. He had just managed to
catch his foe a rending prod in the thick of the
haunch. The wolf never paused&mdash;he was under
the iron discipline of the pack,&mdash;but as he ran he
left a scarlet trail along the snow behind him.</p>
<p>To the slow amazement of the herd, their
enemies now, in the next instant, had vanished
through the thin whirl of the drift. Heavy heads,
thrust far out from the phalanx, turned to stare
after them. There was nothing to be seen but the
endless, sheeted procession of the snow. There
was nothing to be heard but the muffled rush of
<span class="pb" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
the wind and their own snortings and tramplings.
For a long time, however, they kept their array
unbroken, fearing a trick on the part of their adversaries.
Then at last the old bull, after sniffing
the wind in all directions with uplifted muzzle,
stepped forth from the ranks. Immediately the
circle dissolved. There was a moment of whirling
and grunting, of butting at stupid calves or
reorganizing the array, then, at a swift walk, the
whole herd moved off toward the northeast, where
they knew of a region of low huddled hills which
would give them the kind of shelter that they loved.</p>
<p>In the meantime the pack, maddened by failure
and ravenous from the view of food denied, had
resumed the trail of the man. They were different
beings now from the wary skulkers who had been
following him from afar. Silent and swift, their
eyes flaming coldly and their thin lips wrinkled
back from long white fangs, they swept over the
brink and down into the windless hollow of the
stunted firs.</p>
<p>The man, sleeping in his furs by the little fire,
had a bad dream. With a struggle and a yell he
awoke from it, to find himself half erect, upon one
knee, battling frantically for his life. One great
hairy form he had clutched by the throat with
both hands, as its fangs snapped within an inch of
his face, and its huge hot breath daunted him with
<span class="pb" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
a sense that the end of things had come. With a
monstrous effort he hurled it off, but in the same
moment he was borne down from behind. It
seemed to him that a wave of furred, fighting
bodies, enormous and irresistible, went over him,
blotting out everything, even to the desire of life.
He was but half conscious of the fangs that sank
into his flesh, strangely without pain. He was
but half conscious of struggling&mdash;the mere instinctive
struggle of his strong muscles, and already
condemned as futile by his aloof and scornful
spirit. Then nothing but a knot of great gray
wolves, tussling and snarling over something on
the snow.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>After everything on the sledge had been torn
open and investigated, and scattered over the
blood-stained snow, the wolves drew off to a little
distance from the fire, which they hated and
dreaded. It was a victory which would make
that pack for the future tenfold more dangerous.
They had dared and vanquished man. But what
was one man and a little bag of dry pemmican to
such hunger as theirs? All at once, as if moved
simultaneously by one impulse, they gathered, sped
up out of the firs into the wind, and swept away
through the storm on the trail of the musk-ox herd.</p>
<p>The herd, though travelling fast, had not gone
<span class="pb" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
far. On a sudden, as if at a premonition of peril,
the old bull halted with a loud snort. Neither
smell nor sound of his enemies had reached him,
but he took alarm, and gave the signal to form
phalanx for defence, at the same time galloping
around the flank of the herd to close up and
strengthen the rear. The evolution was prompt
and swift. But before it was quite accomplished,
up from the white obscurity of the storm, in silence,
came the leaping wolves.</p>
<p>Straight into the gap in the rear of the herd
they hurled themselves, slashing on every side
with the aim of spreading a panic. A young
bull, just in the act of whirling furiously to confront
the attack, was caught full on the flank, and
went down coughing, his throat torn clean out.
A young cow, with one wolf snapping at her side,
but failing to gain a vital spot, and another on her
back, biting for her neck through the matted
mane, went mad with terror, and charged straight
in among the calves at the centre of the herd,
making a way for the whole pack.</p>
<p>In a second several of the calves, bawling frantically,
were pulled down. The wolves, mad with
blood and their late triumph over the man, were
in a riot of slaughter. The herd was cleft and
rent asunder to the heart. The victory seemed
overwhelming.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">[208]</div>
<p>But there was one thing which the pack had
<i>not</i> reckoned with&mdash;the indomitable pluck and
generalship of the old bull. Blindly confident
in their leader, the herd hung together stolidly,
instead of disintegrating. The front ranks turned
inward upon the bloody convulsion of the centre.
At the same time the old bull, followed by a
couple of raging cows in quest of their young
calves, came plunging in behind the pack and fell
upon its rear like battering rams. In a moment
the flanks closed in behind them, and the completed
circle, instead of flying to pieces, began
ponderously to constrict.</p>
<p>As the wolves realized what was happening,
the two hindermost whirled about, just in time
to leap savagely at the old bull&rsquo;s neck, one on
each side. But they had no room to act effectively,
no chance to choose their hold. As he
charged with head down and the full impetus of
his bulk, their fangs gashed him to the shoulder,
but slantingly, so that the wounds were not deep.
In his rage he never felt them. The next moment
his two assailants were borne down, gored
and trampled, by the frantic cows, while he
lurched onward into the hideous <i>m&ecirc;l&eacute;e</i> at the
centre. A second more, and the churning,
snorting mass became wedged almost solid.
Snapping silently at whatever was in reach, the
<span class="pb" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
wolves were overborne, trodden down with the
dead or dying calves. The leader of the pack,
with two of the more astute of his followers, succeeded
in dragging himself forth upon the packed
shoulders of his adversaries, ran over the heaving
sea of backs, and raced away through the storm,
gored and streaming. Soon there was no sign
of a wolf anywhere to be seen. But still the
packed herd went on with its trampling and
churning, sullenly resolute to make an end of
the matter, till even the sturdy unwounded calves
were in danger of being downed, and the weaker
ones perished miserably. At last, in some way,
the old bull managed to make his orders understood.
The milling slackened, the pressure relaxed.
Ponderously he shouldered his way out,
and started off once more toward the northeast.
Instantly the herd followed, lumbering at his
heels. A few, badly wounded, limped and staggered
in the rear, and three cows, their eyes rolling
wildly, remained standing over certain shapeless
masses that lay trodden into the red snow. For
some minutes they stood there, mooing disconsolately;
then, one after the other, they shook their
shaggy heads and galloped away in pursuit of the
herd, appalled at the solitude and the sight of so
much death.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">[211]</div>
<h2 id="c12">THE TIGER OF THE SEA</h2>
<p>Through the broad, indolent, green-purple
swells, ruffled and crisped along their
tops by a mild breeze, the cow-orca went wallowing
contentedly, her calf swimming close at her
side. From time to time it rubbed against her,
as if apprehensive in face of the vast and perilous
spaces of the ocean, and seeking covert behind her
short powerful flipper. And from time to time,
being one of the most devoted and assiduous of
all the mothers of the wild, she would gather it
caressingly to her side with that great flipper, or,
whirling half around, touch it inquiringly with her
enormous rounded snout.</p>
<p>She was a good nineteen or twenty feet in length,
the great orca&mdash;or &ldquo;killer whale,&rdquo; as she would
have been dubbed by any sailor or fisherman who
might have chanced to cast eyes upon her. She
would have been recognized at once, from all the
other members of her whale-and-porpoise tribe,
by the immense dorsal fin, not far from five feet
high, rising erect from the broad and massive
black curve of her back, by the two conspicuous
white streaks on her black flank, and by the
<span class="pb" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
sharply defined line of her cream-white belly as
she rolled lazily on the slope of a swell. All
these were danger signals, which the knowing
would have taken care to heed.</p>
<p>Little cause for apprehension had the calf of the
orca, as long as it kept near its mother. For this
most swift and savage of all the cetaceans feared
nothing that swam, except her giant cousin, the
cachalot or sperm-whale. Though but twenty
feet long, she would attack and kill, through the
sheer ferocity of her fury, the great whalebone or
&ldquo;right&rdquo; whale, of fully four times her length and
many times her bulk. Man she might have feared,
had she ever learned his power; but, being poor
in blubber, her tribe had never tempted man to
so difficult and perilous a hunting. There were
sharks, to be sure, that might equal or surpass
her in size, but none to even approach her in
savagery, speed, or cunning. It was in care-free
content, therefore, that she lazed onward through
the bland, untroubled sea, heedless alike of the
surf on the yellow cliffs to her right, and of the
empty spaces of ocean to her left. Such attention
as she could spare from the baby charms of her
calf was given to searching the transparent deeps
below her, where lurked the big squid and sluggish,
bottom-feeding fish on which she habitually
preyed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">[215]</div>
<p>Suddenly, with no sound but a vast sucking
gurgle as the waters closed above her, she dived.
Far down in the obscurity she had caught sight
of a pallid, sprawling form. It was an octopus,
which had been so ill-advised as to leave its customary
home among the rocks of the bottom and
seek new feeding-grounds. Before it had time
even to attempt escape, the great jaws of the
&ldquo;killer&rdquo; engulfed it. For one moment its eight
long tentacles writhed desperately, clutching at its
captor&rsquo;s lips. Then they vanished, sucked in and
swallowed at a gulp. Thereupon the orca sailed
leisurely back to the sunlit surface, met on her
way up by her anxious calf, which had not been
quite quick enough to follow its mother&rsquo;s lightning
descent. She had not been two minutes absent,
and never for an instant out of sight, but the
youngster&rsquo;s instinct warned it well that the mild
blue element in which it dwelt was full of dangers.</p>
<p>The octopus, though a large one, had been but
a mouthful for the great killer, a stimulus, merely,
to her vast appetite. She journeyed now with a
keener eye upon the depths. Presently the deep
blue-green of the water began to change to a
lighter, beryl hue, where a line of making reef came
up to within some thirty feet of the surface, and
caught the sun. Here, basking, lay a broad, flat,
bat-like creature, with wing-fins a dozen feet
<span class="pb" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
across, and a long whip-like tail. Its cold moveless
eyes, staring upward, caught sight of the
killer&rsquo;s body, slowly cleaving the surface. With
an almost imperceptible movement of the black
wings, it slid from the reef and plunged for refuge
in the depths.</p>
<p>But the giant ray had not been quick or stealthy
enough to evade its enemy&rsquo;s eye. Again the orca
dived, this time without heed of silence, and so
swiftly that her broad flukes, rising straight into
the air, came down upon the water with a report
that resounded all the way in to shore. Her
descent was straight as a plummet. The ray,
seeing it, was seized with panic. It darted to one
side, and shot upward again, at a terrific pace, on
a magnificent sweeping curve. With the force of
that uprush it hurled its whole black, shuddering
bulk clear into the air, where it turned, and for
one instant hung flapping darkly, as if the very
madness of its terror had driven it to the conquest
of a new element. To the nervous calf it was a
prodigy of horror, blotting out the sun. But
this violent excursion into the air was of only a
second or two&rsquo;s duration, and futile as it was
brief. As the flat black wings came down again,
with an enormous splash, the pursuing orca arose
almost beneath them, seized them, and dragged
them under. There was no fight, the ray being
<span class="pb" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
powerless against its mighty adversary&mdash;only a
moment&rsquo;s blind, frantic struggle in the foaming
swirls, and then a spreading stain of red on the
green sea.</p>
<p>This, now, was a fully sufficing meal, even for
such an appetite as the orca&rsquo;s; and many neglected
fragments of it went spreading and sinking away
to feed the innumerable scavenging crabs that
lurked in the weeds and hollows of the sunken
reef. The orca, for the next half hour or so,
remained where she was, rolling contentedly in
the bright water above the reef, nursing and
caressing her calf, and digesting her meal. Then
she slowly continued her journey, but slanting in
toward shore till she was not more than half a
mile from the chain of precipitous islets and
broken promontories which fringed this dangerous
coast.</p>
<p>It was now full noon, and the unclouded sunlight,
striking almost straight downward upon the
surface of the sea, revealed the bottom at an
amazing depth. Poised about half-way down
the glimmering transparency, a large squid, or
cuttle-fish, was swimming at leisure. His narrow,
tapering body was about six feet in length, and
perhaps twelve or fourteen inches in diameter at
the broadest part, which was the head. From
this formless head, seeming to sprout from it as
<span class="pb" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
leaf-stalks from a carrot, grew a bunch of tentacles,
ten in number, and of about the same length as
the body. Body and tentacles alike were of a
pallid, dirty yellow-gray, with brownish spots&mdash;a
color that made its wearer almost invisible in
that sun-penetrated sea. The progress of the
squid was backward; and he achieved it, not by
moving his tentacles, but by sucking a volume of
water into a great muscular sac beneath the tentacles
and forcibly expelling it again. It looked as if
he were breathing water and using it to blow himself
along.</p>
<p>The orca was by no means hungry so soon
after the feast which she had made on the giant
ray, but the succulent morsel of the squid was a
temptation not to be resisted. Tipping smoothly,
her huge but finely modelled black-and-white
form shot straight downward through the shimmering
flood. But before she could reach him,
the squid looked up and saw her. On the instant
his ten loose tentacles tightened to a rigid bundle
which offered no obstruction to his progress; his
pale sides contracted with a mighty convulsion,
expelling a volume of water which shot him along
with the speed of a torpedo from its tube; and at
the same time, from a gland within the propulsion
sac, he squirted forth a jet of inky fluid which
spread at once into a great cloud of black, veiling
<span class="pb" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
his flight. Behind that concealment he changed
his direction, and fled downward toward a deep
crevice in the rocky bottom, where he knew that
the jaws of his enemy would not be able to reach
him.</p>
<p>The orca, undeterred, plunged straight onward
into the inky cloud. But once well within that
gloom she lost all track of her intended prey.
She also, for the moment, lost herself. This
way and that she darted, snapping her vast jaws
ravenously, but in vain. They closed on nothing
but the empty and tainted water. At last, and
quite unexpectedly, she emerged from the blackness
into the transparent green, and, glancing upward,
saw a sight which caused her to hurl herself
madly to the surface with a Titanic sweep of her
great flanks. That furious stroke made the depths
boil like the thrust of a liner&rsquo;s propellers.</p>
<p>The calf, having started to follow its mother
into the depths, had been frightened by that inky
cloud into which it had seen her vanish. Returning
in a flurry to the surface, it was swimming
around aimlessly and anxiously, when it caught
the eye of a wandering shark.</p>
<p>The shark, knowing very well what it was,
looked around for the mother. He had no
desire to be uncivil to a mother orca; but there
was no mother in sight. He did not understand
<span class="pb" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
it; but he was ragingly hungry, and such an
opportunity was quite irresistible. He rose at the
calf with a rush, and turned over on his side,
exposing his livid-white belly, to seize the prize.
The calf, appalled at the black, triangular, many-toothed
cavern which gaped so suddenly before
it, writhed away just in time, and began swimming
in a big circle around the spot where its
mother had dived.</p>
<p>Again the shark rushed; but he had to turn on
his side to bring his curious underset jaws into
play, and the calf of the orca had already the
nimbleness of its tribe. Again the attack failed.
Before he could repeat it, he caught sight of the
mother shooting up from the green depths.
Though he was some twenty-five feet in length&mdash;a
good five feet longer than the orca&mdash;he turned
and fled for his life.</p>
<p>One glance assured the mother that her little
one was unhurt. Then she darted after the
aggressor at a pace which made his flight quite
futile. He had not gone fifty yards when she
was upon him, open-jawed. Hurling himself
convulsively aside, he just succeeded in evading
that first resistless charge. With the courage
of desperation he twisted himself about, turned
half over, glided beneath his adversary&rsquo;s belly,
and caught at her with his triangular jaws. But
<span class="pb" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
she had already swerved, and he failed to get a
fair hold. He did, indeed, rend out a mass of
hide and blubber, but he reached no vital point,
and the raging killer hardly felt the wound.
Whirling with a violence that sent the foam and
spray spurting into the air, she caught the base
of the shark&rsquo;s tail between her immense jaws.</p>
<p>As far as anything like a fight was concerned,
this was the end of it. For several minutes
the gigantic struggle went on, dashing the discolored
water yards high; but it was all on
one side, as the orca shook and crushed and
tore the life out of her beaten opponent. At
last she drew off, leaving a mangled mass to
sink slowly into the depths. Then, having
snuggled the excited calf under her fin, and
given him to nurse, she swam slowly inland
toward the deep channel which here ran between
the islands and the shore, where she thought
she might find some more of those succulent
squid to compensate her for the one which had
so inconsiderately evaded her approaches.</p>
<p>The breeze, which hitherto had been little but
a succession of cat&rsquo;s-paws, now settled into a
steady draft, though not strong enough to
do more than darken the surface of the sea to
a heavy purple. Running free before it, up
along the coast, between the cliffs and the islands,
<span class="pb" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
came a small cat-boat, its one sail sparkling
white in the clear sunshine.</p>
<p>The tiny craft contained two passengers&mdash;the
man at the helm, smoking a big brier pipe,
and a silky brown retriever curled up at the
foot of the mast. It was a stern coast and a
dangerous water for such a cockle-shell to traverse;
but the man was a good amateur navigator
of small craft, and he knew that, between the
port which he had left, some fifteen miles back
down the coast, and the harbor which he was
making for, a dozen miles to the north, there
were plenty of refuges wherein he could take
shelter in case a sudden storm should blow up
out of the east. These waters were unfamiliar
to him, but he had a good chart; and this was
his special delight&mdash;the coasting of unknown
shores, with no companionship but that of his
faithful and accommodating dog, who always
agreed with him as to the most interesting places
to visit.</p>
<p>But though Gardner was an expert yachtsman,
with an eye wise to all signs of the weather,
and an instinct that could feel the pulse of the
wind through tiller or taut sheet, he knew something
less of natural history than was desirable
for one who made his playground on the peopled
seas. His notions of all the whale tribe and their
<span class="pb" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
varying characters were based on what he had
read of the great timorous whalebone whale,
and what he had seen of the merry and harmless
porpoise. When, therefore, he caught sight of
the arched black back and formidable head of
the orca, lazily ploughing the swells, it never
occurred to him that now was the time for discretion.
Had he been an <i>habitu&eacute;</i> of these waters,
he would have turned his prow promptly in
another direction, lest the orca should think he
wanted to intrude upon her privacy. As it was,
however, he sailed nearer, to see what manner
of fish or beast it might be, this black-and-white
creature that treated his approach with such
indifference.</p>
<p>Passing at a distance of eighty or a hundred
yards, Gardner was seized with a fool idea. This
was a good chance for a shot. The unknown
beast would form an interesting trophy. He
did not stop to consider what he should do with
it if he bagged it. He did not stop to consider
that with his light rifle he could not hope to do
more than inflict a painful wound through the
layers of blubber which would protect the vitals
of this sea-monster. He did not know, either,
that a dead whale sinks to the bottom, and
that therefore the most successful shot could
bring him no reward. It was enough that the
<span class="pb" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
instinct to kill something was upon him. He
flung a knee over the tiller to keep his course
steady, snatched up the rifle, and fired at a
spot just behind the orca&rsquo;s big flipper&mdash;somewhere
about where he judged the heart would
lie. As he did so, the dog, realizing that there
was some excitement afoot, sprang up, put his
forepaws on the gunwale, and barked furiously at
the strange black shape there rolling in the swell.</p>
<p>To Gardner&rsquo;s astonishment, the monster itself
made no immediate response to the shot, but
instantly, just under its flank, there began a wild
commotion. Something there fell to threshing
the water frantically, and the monster, swinging
about, gazed at that something with great and
anxious concern. She stroked it with her flipper,
as if trying to calm it; and then Gardner saw
that it was the young of the monster that he had
struck. At this he felt full of remorse. Had he
seen the calf, he would not have fired at either
parent or little one. He was not wantonly cruel,
but only thoughtless. For a few seconds he
stared irresolutely. Then, judging from its
actions that the calf had received a mortal wound,
he decided that he ought to put it out of its
misery. Taking very careful aim, he fired again.
The report echoed sharply from the cliff-face
of an island not a hundred feet away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">[225]</div>
<p>Gardner had made a good shot this time.
Before the echoes of the report had died out,
the calf lay still, and then very slowly began
to sink. There was stillness for a few
seconds, broken only by the excited barking
of the brown retriever. The orca swam slowly
half around the body of her young, and apparently
assured herself that it was dead. Then
she turned her small eyes upon the boat. It
was only for an instant, but in that instant
Gardner realized that he had made a hideous
mistake. Instinctively he headed the boat for
the rocky islet.</p>
<p>As he jammed the tiller over, at the same
time hurriedly freeing his sheet, he saw the
water boil about the orca&rsquo;s black form. She
was a good hundred feet away, but so appalling
was her rush that she seemed to be upon him in
the same instant. With a yelp the dog sprang
far up into the bow. As the boat was at
that moment broadside on to the terrific attack,
Gardner kept his seat, and fired another desperate
shot full in the face of the oncoming
doom. He might as well have fired a pea-shooter.</p>
<p>The gun dropped to his feet. In the same
moment it was as if an express train had
struck the boat. She was lifted bodily from the
<span class="pb" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
water, and all one side crushed in, while Gardner
felt himself hurled clean over the boom.
As he came down, he heard a yelp from the
brown retriever.</p>
<p>In order to escape entanglement in the sail,
which slapped sousing over on top of him,
Gardner dived, and came up some fifteen feet
beyond. To this dive, and to the momentary
concealment afforded by the sail, he doubtless
owed his life. He was a crack swimmer, and
instantly started for the island at sprinting
speed, doing the &ldquo;crawl&rdquo; stroke, with head
most of the time under water. The orca at
first did not observe his escape. The unhappy
dog, by his barking, had caught her eye, and
him she had seized and crushed the instant
he was thrown into the water. Then, turning
her fury upon the wreck of the boat, she
had torn it and smashed it to kindling-wood,
seizing it in her huge jaws and shaking it as
a terrier shakes a rat. This done, she had
turned toward the island, and her deadly eyes
had fallen upon the form of the swimming
man as he cleft his way shoreward.</p>
<p>Her rush was like the rush of a torpedo;
but Gardner was already laying his frantic
hands upon the ledge. The ledge&mdash;a shelf
not a dozen inches in width&mdash;was just awash.
<span class="pb" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
He felt that it was no refuge. But at about
his own height above him was a niche in the
rock, whimsically gouged out as if to hold a
statue. With desperate agility he drew himself
up into the tiny retreat, whipping up his legs
behind him, and shrinking as flat as possible
into the niche. At the same moment he was
deluged with foam and spray, as with a dull
crash the body of his pursuer struck the rock
just below his feet.</p>
<p>Gardner shuddered, and struggled gaspingly
to catch back his breath into his laboring
lungs. He had swum many races, but never
one like that. Turning cautiously, and keeping
himself still flattened like a limpet to the back
of the niche, he stared down, trembling lest
the avenger should essay another such mad
leap, and with better effect.</p>
<p>But the orca did not seem disposed to try
it again. The shock of her impact had been
terrific, and must have more or less driven
the breath from her body. She was now
swimming slowly to and fro before the rock,
a grim and dreadful jailer. Gardner looked
down into her cold little eyes, and shivered at
the intelligent and implacable hate that flamed
in them.</p>
<p>When he found himself sufficiently recovered
<span class="pb" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
to consider his situation, he was forced to acknowledge
it a rather desperate one. Reaching outward
and upward as far as he could, his hands
found no protuberance of the rock by the aid of
which he might hope to climb out of his niche
and so make his way to the top of the cliff. He
had no way of judging how long his vengeful
jailer might remain on duty; but from the magnitude
of the wrong he had done her, the business-like
method of her patrol, and the effective fury
which she had shown in her attack, he had little
reason to hope that she would soon tire of her
office. In those teeming seas, as he knew, she
could find plenty to eat without forsaking her
post. But if those seas were teeming with sea-life,
he reflected ruefully that they were at the
same time rather barren of ships. The coasting
schooners were apt to give that part of the coast
a wide berth, owing to its sunken reefs and awkward
currents. His island, to be sure, was little
more than half a mile from shore&mdash;an easy
enough swim for him under ordinary circumstances.
But, even with his jailer out of the
way, he had no relish for running the gantlet of
the giant sharks which haunted the island channels.
Exposed as he was to the full glare of the sun&mdash;the
rock around him was uncomfortably hot beneath
his hands,&mdash;he wondered how long it would
<span class="pb" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
be before heat and thirst would so overcome him
that his legs would crumple under his weight, and
he would topple forward into the jaws of his waiting
foe. On this point, however, he was presently
somewhat reassured, as he noted that the sun
would very soon pass over the shoulder of the
cliff and leave him in the shade. As far as the
heat was concerned, he would be fairly secure
until the next morning. But then, if the weather
should continue fine, how would he endure the
long intolerable blaze of the forenoon, before the
sun should again go over the cliff? He began
to pray for storm and shrouded skies. But here
he stopped himself, realizing his dilemma. If
storm should come, it was likely at that season
to come out of the southeast; and in such event
the first rising seas would lick him from his perch.
He decided hastily that it was best to make his
prayer a general one, and hazard no dangerous
suggestions to Providence.</p>
<p>Fumbling instinctively in his pocket, he drew
forth his soaked and sopping tobacco-pouch and a
box of wet matches. The latter included some
wax vestas, and he had a dim hope that these, if
carefully dried and properly coaxed, might perhaps
be induced to light. He spread them out, with
the tobacco, on the hot rock between his feet.
He had lost his pipe in the catastrophe, but he
<span class="pb" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
had letters in his pocket, and with these, when
dried, he planned to roll cigarettes. The enterprise
gave him something to do, helping him to
pass the weary afternoon. But in the end he
found that none of the matches would afford him
so much as a sputter. Angrily he threw their
futile remnants into the sea.</p>
<p>Night fell suddenly, as always in those latitudes,
and the moonlight enchanted the long swells to
the smoothness of glass. All night the orca
swam backward and forward before the rock,
till the changeless monotony of her movements
began to hypnotize her prisoner, and he turned
his eyes to the cliff-face to escape its influence.
He was in deadly fear of dropping to sleep in his
weariness, and falling out of the niche. His legs
were giving way beneath him, and there was not
room in the niche for him to sit down, or even to
crouch with any comfort. At last, in desperation,
he decided to take the risk of letting his legs
hang over the edge, where his enemy could reach
them if she should dare another of her wild leaps
into the air. The moment he seated himself in
this position she swam nearer and eyed him with
unutterable malignancy. But she did not attempt
to repeat her flying rush. It was plain to
Gardner that she had no relish for such another
violent concussion with the rock.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">[231]</div>
<p>At last the interminable night wore itself away.
The moon had long disappeared over the cliff,
when the velvet purple of the sky began to thin
and chill, the stars to pale and fade. Then the
measureless splendor of an unclouded tropic
dawn broke over the sea, and the shining plane
of the waters seemed to tilt downward to meet the
sun. Gardner gathered all his weary strength to
face the fiery ordeal that he felt to be before
him.</p>
<p>The better to fortify himself against it, he took
off his light coat, and, by the aid of some pieces
of cord which he found in his pockets, he lowered
the garment and drenched it well in the sea. The
orca darted in to see what he was doing, but he
drew up the dripping coat before she could seize
it. He felt that this idea was nothing less than
an inspiration, for, by keeping his head and body
well drenched, he would be able to endure almost
any heat, and might at the same time, by absorption,
hope to ward off for a time the extreme
torments of his thirst.</p>
<p>As the relenting Fates decreed, however, his
trial was presently to be ended. Along about nine
o&rsquo;clock in the morning, from somewhere behind
the island came throbbing on the still air a harsh,
staccato <i>chug</i>&mdash;<i>chug</i>&mdash;<i>chug</i>&mdash;<i>chug</i>, which was to
Gardner&rsquo;s ears the divinest of melodies. In an
<span class="pb" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
instant he had stripped his light shirt over his
head and was holding it in eager hands. A
moment more, and a powerful forty-foot motor-launch
came into view. She was about a hundred
and fifty yards away, and making a lot of racket.
But Gardner, yelling wildly and flapping his
shirt in the air, succeeded in catching her attention.
She turned in toward the rock; but in the
next instant the noise of the motor stopped, and
she swerved off again. The pilot had caught
sight of Gardner&rsquo;s jailer.</p>
<p>There were three men in the launch. One of
them hailed the prisoner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; he demanded concisely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shot that brute&rsquo;s calf yesterday,&rdquo; answered
Gardner, &ldquo;and she smashed up my boat and
chased me up here on to this rock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was silence for a moment on the launch.
Then the captain answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any fellow that&rsquo;s looking for trouble can
generally find it by starting in to fool with a
&lsquo;killer,&rsquo;&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve thought since that I had made a
mistake,&rdquo; said Gardner dryly. &ldquo;But that was
yesterday morning, and I&rsquo;m pretty near all in.
Come and take me off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a brief consultation on the launch.
The orca, meanwhile, continued her patrol before
<span class="pb" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
the rock, as if such things as forty-foot motor-boats
were not worth noticing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to hang on a bit longer,&rdquo; shouted
the captain, &ldquo;while we run back to port and get
a whale gun. We&rsquo;ve got a heavy rifle here, but
it&rsquo;s not safe to tackle her with that, for, if we
didn&rsquo;t fix her first shot, she&rsquo;d make matchwood
of this launch in about ten seconds. We&rsquo;ll be
back inside of an hour, so don&rsquo;t fret.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks!&rdquo; said Gardner; and, sweeping off
in a wide curve, the launch disappeared behind
the island.</p>
<p>It seemed to the imprisoned man a terribly
long hour, and he had occasion to bless the
cool dripping jacket before he again heard the
<i>chug</i>&mdash;<i>chug</i>&mdash;<i>chug</i>&mdash;<i>chug</i> of the motor clamoring
behind his prison. This time, as soon as it
came in sight, it bore straight down upon the
orca. In its bow, as it slid gracefully dipping
over the smooth swell, Gardner remarked a
strange gun, a sort of short big-bore rifle on a
swivel. The orca now took note of the fact
that the launch was heading straight for her.
She paused in her tireless patrolling, and eyed it
defiantly, hesitating as to whether she should
attack it or not.</p>
<p>The launch reversed propellers till her progress
came to a stop, while her captain sighted the
<span class="pb" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
weapon in her bow. There was a mighty report.
The monster flung herself half-way out of the
water, and fell back with a gigantic splash. For
a moment she rushed madly around in a half
circle, then crashed headlong into the cliff, gave
one violent shudder, and slowly sank to a fringing
reef about two fathoms down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you plenty of water right up to your
ledge?&rdquo; demanded the captain, as the launch
drew slowly in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plenty,&rdquo; said Gardner, swinging down
stiffly from his niche and standing ready to crawl
aboard.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_235">[235]</div>
<h2 id="c13">GRAY LYNX&rsquo;S LAST HUNTING</h2>
<p>Gray Lynx went ahead. His mate, almost
as large as he, and even more savage
in her lightning ferocity, was at the same time
more shy of approaching the habitations of man.
Full of suspicions, but driven by the pangs of
midwinter famine, she followed at a little distance,
while Gray Lynx, stealthily, crouching close to
the snow, led the way across the open to the low,
snow-muffled outbuildings of the lonely wilderness
farm.</p>
<p>He was a strange, sinister figure, this great
Canadian lynx, a kind of gigantic, rough-haired
cat with the big, broad, disproportionate pads of
a half-grown Newfoundland pup, and hind legs
and haunches grotesquely over-developed as if in
imitation of a jack-rabbit. His moon face, stiffly-whiskered,
and with a sort of turned-back ruff
beneath the blunt, strong jaws, was indescribably
wild and savage, lit as it was by a pair of round,
unwinking, palely luminous eyes, and surrounded
by sharp ears fantastically tufted. In color he
was all of a shadowy, light gray, faintly toned on
back and flanks with a brownish yellow. His
<span class="pb" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
grotesque but extraordinarily powerful hindquarters
were finished off with a straight stub of
a tail, perhaps three inches or four in length. He
might, in fact, have looked like a caricature, but
for the appearance of power and speed and deadly
efficiency which he conveyed, the suggestion of
menace in every movement.</p>
<p>Under the necessity of the Hungry Month,
the big lynx had visited this clearing once before,
prowling as near as he dared, in the first shadows
of late afternoon. He had seen in the yard a
couple of cows&mdash;which were too big to interest
him. What was more to his purpose, he had
seen some huddling sheep. Then a draft of
icy air blowing from the direction of the house
had borne to his nostrils the dreaded scent of
man, and he had slunk off hurriedly to his coverts.
But those sheep! The smell of them, the remembered
relish of a lamb which he had once devoured
in the thickets, stung his appetite to madness.
Like most of the wild creatures, he had
learned, either from instinct or experience, that
man was less to be dreaded by night than by day.
So, well after nightfall, he had returned to the
farm, bringing his ravenous mate with him.</p>
<p>At one side of the yard, startlingly bright in
the light of the low moon, stood the settler&rsquo;s
house; at the other side, two low, connected
<span class="pb" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
barns, with a shed running half-way to the house.
The long, black shadows of the buildings stretched
nearly across the open space, between the farmstead
and the woods. The snow was hard packed
and frozen, covered with an inch of recent and
lighter snowfall, which the winds would presently
come and sweep away into the fence-corners.
Through the space of shadow Gray Lynx crept
like a denser shadow, till he reached the corner of
the nearest barn. Here he crouched, making
himself as small as possible, while he took a long
sniff at one of the cracks in the warped, ill-seasoned,
hemlock boarding. Then he turned his head and
looked at his mate, who was crouching some ten
paces to the rear. As if this was a signal that all
was as it should be, she ran lightly forward and
crouched again beside him.</p>
<p>From within, besides that warm, distracting,
woolly smell, came comfortable rustlings of dry
hay, and sounds of chewing, and safe contented
breathings. It was obvious that the sheep were
in there. Gray Lynx&rsquo;s eyes, piercing and impatient,
searched the blank wall before him. There
was no entrance from that side. Furtively he led
the way round the corner, his mate still keeping
a prudent distance. At the edge of the moonlit
yard he hesitated. Still there was no opening.
Keeping carefully in the shadow, he prowled
<span class="pb" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
around to the other corner of the building, but
with no better luck. Then, growing more bold,
he ventured into the light and crept down the
front of the barn, flattening himself to the snow
as he went; his mate, distrustful still, and now
growing angry as she began to feel that she had
been fooled, peered around the corner and
watched him.</p>
<p>Gray Lynx was furious. He had expected to
see those sheep still huddled in the yard. Finding
that they were inside the barn, he then expected
to get in among them by the same way they
themselves had entered. Where such fools as
sheep could, surely he could go. He knew nothing
of doors that closed and opened, so he was
puzzled. He drew back and stared up at the
roof. Assuredly, the sheep must have got in by
way of the roof. He could see no opening up
there, however, so he went prowling around the
other barn and the shed as well, finding everything
shut up tightly against the biting cold.
Then he came again to his mate, who was now
awaiting him, tail and whiskers twitching with ill-humor,
in the shadow behind the first barn.</p>
<p>But Gray Lynx was not yet ready to acknowledge
defeat. The roof of the shed was lower
than that of the barns. With a tremendous leap
he gained it, but only to fall back ignominiously
<span class="pb" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
beneath a mass of snow which his claws had disengaged.
At the next attempt, however, he got
a grip with his front paws upon the roof itself,
and so drew himself up, but not without a sharp
noise of scraping and clawing. The sudden
sound disturbed the hens, roosting inside immediately
below the roof, and they set up a shrill
cackling of alarm.</p>
<p>Gray Lynx stopped, held himself rigid, and
listened with all his ears. Chickens would do him
almost as well as sheep&mdash;if only he could come
at them! He clawed savagely at the roof, but
it was new and strong, and he speedily found that
there was nothing to be hoped for by that method
of procedure. Frantic with baffled eagerness, he
ran along the shed and sprang with a magnificent
bound to the roof of the barn. At the thud of
his landing the cattle stirred and snorted uneasily,
and the two horses whinnied with anxious interrogation.</p>
<p>At this instant a window in the farmhouse flew
up with a clatter. Gray Lynx turned his flat,
cruel face sharply toward the sound. He saw a
jet of flame spurt from the window; a crashing
thunder shocked his ears, and something hummed
viciously close above his head. Fortunately for
him, the light of the moon is a deceptive light to
shoot by. He left no chance, however, for the
<span class="pb" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
settler to try a second shot. With one wild leap
he cleared the roof and alighted on the snow behind
the barn. He saw his mate already fleeing,
and he followed in long, panic-stricken bounds.</p>
<p>Well within the shelter of the woods, Gray
Lynx found his mate awaiting him. She stood
with her head turned back over her shoulder,
eying him dangerously. What she conveyed to
him by that look is not with any certainty to be
recorded; but it seemed to be unpleasant in its
drift, for Gray Lynx turned aside, in a casual way,
and pretended to sniff interestedly at the day-old
trail of a rabbit. It was difficult, however, to assume
an interest for any length of time in anything
so hopelessly uninteresting. After a few
seconds he wandered off stealthily, in search of
some fresher trail. His mate, though hot with
scorn and disappointment, ranged along within a
few leaps of him. In such a famine season it was
to the interest of both that they should hunt together,
so far as their morose and distrustful
natures made it possible.</p>
<p>The stillness of death itself lay on the forest.
The very air seemed brittle under the intense
cold. The glare of the unclouded moon was
glassy, hard, implacable. It seemed to devitalize
even the strong, stealthy forms of the gliding
lynxes, to change them into a pair of drifting
<span class="pb" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
ghosts, which turned their heads from side to side
as they went, and flashed from their eyes a pale,
blasting fire.</p>
<p>But Gray Lynx had a very unghostly hunger&mdash;as
had also his mate. Suddenly his unerring
eyes detected, under a spreading hemlock, a spot
where the snow had been disturbed. To a less
keen vision it would have been nothing, but to
Gray Lynx it was a clear, unmistakable indication.
Swerving sharply from his trail, he pounced upon
the little roughness in the snow, and began digging
furiously with his forepaws. In a moment
he was half buried, for the snow, here in the
shelter of the trees, lay softer than in the wind-beaten
fields. Sniffing his way by his well-instructed
nose, he followed a deep trail which led
in toward the trunk of the hemlock. His mate,
meanwhile, drew near and watched enviously. A
moment more and his head emerged amid a swirl
of fluttering wings and flying snow. In his jaws
he held a big cock-grouse. The unhappy bird
had buried himself in the snow for the night, that
he might sleep more warmly than on his roost
among the branches. For a second more his
strong wings flapped spasmodically, then Gray
Lynx crunched the life out of him and fell to his
meal.</p>
<p>The ill-humored female crept nearer, crouching
<span class="pb" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
with a conciliatory air. But Gray Lynx
was not of a gallant or chivalrous tribe, and a
single cock-grouse is not half a meal for a starving
lynx. With a strident snarl he thrust out
one great paw in warning. The female stopped,
licked her lips hungrily, then turned like lightning
and ran up a neighboring fir-tree. Her ears had
caught the sound of a startled twitter which had
answered Gray Lynx&rsquo;s snarl. There were snow-buntings
resting in that tree. Her iron claws,
however, clutching at the bark, announced her
coming, and for all her speed the birds escaped
her, hopping up with terrified outcry to the topmost
slender branches, where she could not go.
Smarting with disappointment, she descended the
tree, and continued her prowl at a distance of
some twenty paces from her selfish partner, who
had by this time finished up the grouse.</p>
<p>For perhaps half an hour nothing more happened,
and the temper of Gray Lynx&rsquo;s mate grew
momently more dangerous. It was bad enough
to be so hungry as she was, but to be first led into
a trap by Gray Lynx and then to see him make
a meal before her eyes, this was hardly to be
borne. All at once she gave a great leap to one
side, turning in the air as she sprang, and came
down, with forepaws outstretched and claws wide
spread, just at the edge of a snow-draped bush.
<span class="pb" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
Out of the corner of her eye she had seen a wood-mouse.
With her miraculous speed of action, as
of a mighty spring unloosed, she had caught the
tiny victim just as it was vanishing under the refuge.
It made but one mouthful, to be sure, but
it was quite as good as a snow-bunting would have
been. She licked her chops, gave Gray Lynx a
sidelong look, and crept on.</p>
<p>Slowly the moon rolled up the vitreous sky,
shortening the shadows of tree and stump. The
forest was more open here, having been recently
gone over by the lumbermen. Dense thickets,
single trees, ranks of stumps, aisles and colonnades
of tall second growth, not yet quite heavy
enough for the woodsman&rsquo;s axe, succeeded each
other in bewildering confusion. By and by, from
a hemlock stump just ahead but hidden by some
bushes, came a crisp sound of gnawing. Both
lynxes crouched flat, their absurd tails twitching.
Then, separating so that one should go to each
side of the clump of bushes, they crept upon the
heedless gnawer. As they came in sight of him,
they stopped. It was a big porcupine, fat, warmly
clad, and indifferent alike to foe and frost.</p>
<p>Full well the lynxes knew that this was no
quarry for their hunting. But they could not
help dallying with the temptation. They stole
nearer, their mouths watering. The porcupine
<span class="pb" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
went on gnawing the dry hemlock; but when the
lynxes were come within a few feet of him, he
stopped, put his nose between his forepaws, and
erected his needle-pointed quills, till there was
nothing of him to be seen but this threatening
array. The lynxes crouched flat, and eyed him
longingly. At last the female, her hunger getting
the better of her discretion, stole closer and
reached out a prying nose, as if hoping to find
some weak point in the scornful rodent&rsquo;s defences.
Gray Lynx snarled a warning; but in that same
instant the porcupine&rsquo;s tail&mdash;a massive member
covered with tiniest needles&mdash;jerked sharply and
just brushed the intruding muzzle. With a spitting
yowl, the lynx jumped backward, two or
three slender quills sticking in her nose like pins
in a cushion. Paw and rub and wallow as she
might, she could not get them out, for their barbed
edges held inexorably. All she could do was
break them, and go on, with the points rankling
like wasp-stings in her tender muzzle. From time
to time she would plunge her face in the snow, to
allay the torment. And her temper was by no
means improved.</p>
<p>All this, however, troubled Gray Lynx not at
all. To be sure, the mishap to his mate had
cooled his longing for porcupine meat, and he
had resumed his quest of safe hunting. But concern
<span class="pb" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
for the female&rsquo;s sufferings never entered into
his savage heart. She was of importance to him
only if they should find some big game&mdash;a
strayed sheep or a doe, for instance&mdash;which they
could bring down more surely and more quickly
by acting in combination. There was none of
that close and firm intimacy which so often appears
to exist between the male and female wolf.</p>
<p>In traversing an alley of big spruce stumps,
the two came close together, though they continued
to pay each other not the slightest attention.
A light, dull <i>pad-pad</i> struck their ears, and
both crouched flat. In the next instant a white
rabbit shot past them, almost brushing their noses.
His great, simple eyes starting from his head with
terror, he went by at such a pace that there was
no time to strike him down, though the female,
who was the farthest from him, made a futile
swipe at him with one paw. It was clear that
something deadly must be following the rabbit,
to cause him such blind panic. Whatever it
might be, the lynxes had no fear of it. They
wanted it. And they waited for it.</p>
<p>And the next moment it came.</p>
<p>It came running soundlessly, nose up on the
hot scent, a slim, low, long-bodied, sinuous white
beast, with a sharp-pointed head and eyes like two
drops of liquid fire. As it shot past him, Gray
<span class="pb" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
Lynx made a stroke at it and missed. But in
the next fraction of a second the female had
pounced. She caught the weasel, with both paws,
in mid-leap. Indomitable, it writhed up and
fixed its long, fine teeth in her nose. Then her
fangs closed about its slender loins, and the fierce
life was crunched out of it. With the blood streaming
from her nose&mdash;which eased, however, for
a moment the galling ache of the porcupine barbs&mdash;she
fell to her meat, growling harshly over it.
Gray Lynx, perhaps persuading himself that he
had helped at the hunting of this quarry, demanded
a share, and seized one of the weasel&rsquo;s
hind legs in his teeth. But with a snarl the
female struck at him, clawing viciously the side
of his head. He was in no anxiety to force matters
with so redoubtable an adversary, so, spitting
indignantly, he drew off and sat down on his
haunches to watch the feast.</p>
<p>The feast was brief. For, though the weasel
was a fairly large one, it was by no means so large
as the lynx&rsquo;s hunger. Still, when she had finished,
and passed her great paw over her face and licked
her chest clean of blood, she might have felt fairly
comfortable but for that inexorable anguish in her
nose.</p>
<p>Not long after this another rabbit bounded
forth from a thicket just ahead, and darted straight
<span class="pb" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
between them. Both sprang at it, simultaneously,
but each balked the other; and the rabbit,
stretched out into a tense, white line of flying fur,
shot unscathed from under their claws. Gray
Lynx, as it chanced, had been the nearest to the
quarry. Choosing to think that he would have
made a kill had his mate&rsquo;s interference not
thwarted him, he gave vent to his wrath in a
buffet, which caught her on the flank and sent her
rolling over on the snow. Recovering herself,
she faced him for a moment or two with eyes
that flamed green, half minded to fly at his throat.
Then, thinking better of it, she turned away and
fell to nosing a mouse trail.</p>
<p>The trail was none too fresh, but neither was it
hopelessly stale. She chose to follow it. Thereupon
Gray Lynx, hopeful of something worth
while, stole nearer to see what she might be
trailing.</p>
<p>Now, it chanced that in this particular neighborhood
a trapper had been busy. A morsel of
frozen fish lay upon the snow. Both prowlers
saw it at the same time, and pounced for it. But
it was Gray Lynx who reached it first, and he
bolted it in one mouthful, while his mate snarled
with rage. Sniffing about for other possible fragments,
he stepped to one side. There was a
muffled click beneath the surface of the snow.
<span class="pb" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
Straightway Gray Lynx, doubling himself like a
full-drawn bow, and ripping out a screech of panic,
sprang into the air, with a steel trap hanging to
his left forepaw.</p>
<p>The trap was attached by a chain to a solid
wooden balk, too heavy for Gray Lynx to drag.
Biting savagely at the strange horror which had
clutched him, yowling and spitting, and rolling
head over heels, he lost his wits entirely in the
madness of his efforts to escape. For a moment
the female shrank back, with flattened ears and
narrowed eyes, frightened and bewildered. Then,
seeming to imagine that there was some treachery
to herself in this dreadful and inexplicable performance,
she drew nearer, with a menacing growl.
The next instant, as if quite beside herself at the
sight of such contortions, she gave vent to a mad
screech and flung herself at Gray Lynx&rsquo;s throat.</p>
<p>In a moment the two became, as it were, one
ball of clinging, tearing, screeching fur and claws.
They rolled over and over in the snow, the heavy
trap striking them both impartially, the chain now
entangling them, now flying loose with a sharp
jangle. Blood spattered in every direction, amid
spurts of snow and flecks of torn fur. But Gray
Lynx, hampered by trap and chain, and weakened
alike by terror of the unknown and horror at the
incomprehensible fury of his mate, was overmatched
<span class="pb" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
from the first. In a few minutes the
tense ball seemed to loosen. The maniacal uproar
ceased to affront the night, diminishing to a panting
growl. Gray Lynx&rsquo;s body straightened out.
The female continued to worry it for a few moments.
Then, as if suddenly coming to her
senses, she stopped, drew off, eyed the mangled
and twitching form, and slunk away into the
nearest bushes. Here she crouched, as if in
terror, and peered out fascinated. At last the
shape of what had once been her mate lay quite still.
Then, after a little, she crept away, hid herself in
a remote thicket, and fell to licking her scars and
cleansing her fur. And the outstretched body of
Gray Lynx, with cruel eyes half open and staring
blankly, stiffened little by little in the still, implacable
frost.</p>

<h2 id="c14">MOTHERS OF THE NORTH</h2>
<p>It was in the first full, ardent rush of the Arctic
spring.</p>
<p>Thrilling to the heat of the long, long days of
unobstructed sun, beneath the southward-facing
walls of the glaciers, the thin soil, clothing the
eternal ice, burst into green and flowering life.
In the sunward valleys brooks awoke, with a
sudden filming of grass along their borders, a
sudden passionate unfolding of star-like blooms,
white, yellow, and blue. As if summoned from
sleep by the impetuous blossoms, eager to be
fertilized, came the small northern butterflies in
swarms, with little wasp-like flies and beetles
innumerable. Along the inaccessible ledges of
the cliffs the auks and gulls, in crowded ranks,
screamed and quarrelled over their untidy nests,
or filled the air with wings as they flocked out
over the gray-green, tranquil sea. The world of
the north was trying to forget for a little the implacable
savagery, the deathly cold and dark, of
its winter&rsquo;s torment.</p>
<p>The great, unwieldy, grunting walruses felt it,
too, and responded to it&mdash;this ardor of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
lonely Arctic spring, astray in the wastes. On
the ledges of a rocky islet, just off shore, the
members of a little herd were sunning themselves.
There were two old bulls and four cows
with their sprawling lumps of calves. All were
in a good humor with each other, lying with
heads or foreflippers flung amicably across each
other&rsquo;s grotesque bodies, and grunting, groaning,
grumbling in various tones of content as the
pungent sunlight tickled their coarse hides. All
seemed without a care beneath the sky, except
one of the old bulls. He, being on watch, held
his great tusked and bewhiskered head high above
his wallowing fellows, and kept eyes, ears, and
nose alert for the approach of any peril. One of
the unshapely, helpless-looking calves, with its
mother, lay in a hollow of the rock, perhaps
twenty feet back from the water&rsquo;s edge&mdash;a snug
spot, sheltered from all winds of north and east.
The rest of the herd were grouped so close to the
water&rsquo;s edge that from time to time a lazy, leaden-green
swell would come lipping up and splash
them. The cubs had a tendency to flounder
away out of reach of these chill douches; but
their mothers were very resolute about keeping
them close to the water.</p>
<p>Presently the little group was enlarged by one.
Another old bull, who had been foraging at the
<span class="pb" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
sea-bottom, grubbing up clams, star-fish, and
oysters with his tusks, and crushing them in the
massive mill of his grinders, suddenly shot his
ferocious-looking head above the surface. For
all his gross bulk, in the water he moved with
almost the speed and grace of a seal. In a second
he was at the rock&rsquo;s edge. Hooking his immense
tusks over it, he drew himself up by the force of
his mighty neck, flung forward a broad flipper,
dragged himself out of the water, and flopped
down among his fellows with an explosive grunt
of satisfaction.</p>
<p>They were not, it must be confessed, a very
attractive company, these uncouth sea-cattle. The
adults were from ten to eleven feet in length,
round and swollen-looking as hogsheads, quite
lacking the adornment of tails, and in color
of a dirty yellow-brown. Sparse bristles, scattered
over their hides in rusty patches, gave
them a disreputable, moth-eaten look. Their
short but powerful flippers were ludicrously
splayed. They had the upper half of the head
small, flat-skulled, and earless; while the lower
half, or muzzle, was enormously developed to
support the massive, downward-growing tusks,
twelve to fifteen inches in length. This grotesque
enlargement of the lower jaw was further
emphasized by the bristling growth of long stiff
<span class="pb" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
whiskers which decorated it, giving the wearer an
air of blustering irascibility. As for the calves,
their podgy little forms had the same over-blown
look as those of their parents, but their clean
young hides were not so wrinkled, nor were they
anywhere disfigured by lumps and scars. They
were without tusks, of course, but the huge development
of their muzzles, in preparation for the
sprouting of the tusks, gave them a truculent
air that was ludicrously belied by the mildness
of their baby eyes. They rolled and snuggled
against the mountainous flanks of their mothers,
who watched them with vigilant devotion. The
calf which lay farthest inland, apart from the rest,
was in some pain, and whimpering. That morning
it had got a nasty prod in the shoulder from
the horn of a passing narwhal, and the anxious
mother was trying to comfort it, gathering it
clumsily but tenderly against her side and coaxing
it to nurse. The rest of the herd, for the
moment, was utterly content with life; but the
troubled mother was too much engrossed with her
little one&rsquo;s complaints to notice how caressing was
the spring sun.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, not far away, was another mother
who, in spite of the spring, was equally ill-content.
Down to the shore of the mainland, behind the
island, came prowling a lean white bear with a cub
<span class="pb" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
close at her heels. The narrow bay between island
and mainland was full of huge ice-cakes swung in
by an eddy of the tides. Many of these wave-eaten
and muddied floes were piled up on the
shore along tide-mark, and as their worn edges
softened under the downpour of the sun, they
crumbled and fell with small glassy crashes.
Hither and thither among them stole the fierce-eyed
mother, hoping to find some dead fish or
other edible drift of the sea. She had had bad
hunting of late&mdash;the shoals of the salmon had
been inexplicably delaying their appearance on
the coast&mdash;and she was feeling the pangs of
famine. To be sure, she was filling her stomach,
after a fashion, with the young shoots of rushes
and other green stuff, but this was not the diet
which Nature had framed her for. And in her
lack of right nourishment she was pouring her
very life itself into her breasts, in the effort to
feed her little one. He, too, was suffering, so
scanty was the supply of mother&rsquo;s milk. Even
now, as the great bear stopped to nose a mass of
seaweed, the cub crowded under her flank and
began to nurse, whimpering with disappointment
at the too thin stream he drew. Her fierce eyes
filmed, and she turned her head far round in
order to lick him tenderly.</p>
<p>The stranded ice-floes yielded nothing that a
<span class="pb" id="Page_260">[260]</span>
bear could eat, and she was ranging on down the
shore, disconsolately, when all at once a waft of
air drew in from seaward. It came direct from
the island, and it brought the scent of walrus.
She lifted her long, black-edged muzzle and
sniffed sharply, then stood as rigid as one of the
ice-cakes, and searchingly scrutinized the island.
The cub, either imitating his mother or obeying
some understood signal, stood moveless also.
One of the earliest lessons learned by the youngsters
of the wild is to keep still.</p>
<p>There was not a walrus in sight, but the bear&rsquo;s
nostrils could not deceive her. She knew the
huge sea-beasts were there, on the other side of
the island, and she knew they would be very
much at ease on such a day as this, basking in
the sun. Walruses were not the quarry she
would have chosen. The great bulls, courageous
and hot-tempered, the powerful cows, dauntless
as herself in defence of their young&mdash;she knew
them for antagonists to be avoided whenever possible.
But just now she had no choice. Her
cub was not getting food enough. To her there
was nothing else in the world so important as
that small, troublesome, droll-eyed, hungry cub.</p>
<p>Keeping herself now well out of sight behind
the ice-floes, with the cub close at her heels, she
stole down to the edge of the retreating tide.
<span class="pb" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
The bay was too crowded with slowly-moving
floes to be quite as safe for the cub as she would
have had it, but she could not leave him behind.
She kept him close at her side as she swam. He
was a good swimmer, diving fearlessly when she
dived, his little black nose cutting the gray-green
water bravely and swiftly. In everything he imitated
her stealth, her speed, her vigilance, for he
knew there was big game in this hunting.</p>
<p>The island was a ridge of some elevation, shelving
down by ledges to the sea. The white bear
knew better than to climb the ridge and try to
steal down upon the walruses. She was well
aware that they would be keenly on the watch
against any approach from the landward side.
From that direction came all they feared. When
she arrived at the island, she swam along, close
under shelter of the shore, till she reached the
extremity. Then, behind the shelter of a stranded
floe, she drew herself out, at the same time flattening
herself to the rock till she seemed a part of
it. Every movement the cub copied assiduously.
But when she rose upon her haunches, and laid
her narrow head in a cleft of the ice-floe to peer
over, he kept himself in the background and
watched her with his head cocked anxiously to
one side.</p>
<p>The walruses were in full view, not fifty yards
<span class="pb" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
away. For all the pangs of her hunger, the
mother bear never stirred, but remained for long
minutes watching them, studying the approaches,
while the scent of them came on the light breeze
to her nostrils. She saw that the herd itself was
inaccessible, being well guarded and close to the
water. If she should try to rush them, they
would escape at the first alarm; or if she should
succeed in catching one of the cubs in the
water, she would be overwhelmed in a moment&mdash;caught
by those mighty tusks, dragged to the
bottom, drowned and crushed shapeless. But
with gleaming eyes she noted the cow and calf
lying further up the slope. Here was her chance&mdash;a
dangerous one enough, but still a chance.
She dropped down at last to all fours, crouched
flat, and began worming her way upward among
the rocks, making a covert of the smallest hummock
or projection. The cub still followed her.</p>
<p>It was miraculous how small the great white
beast managed to make herself as she slowly crept
up upon her quarry. Her movements were as
noiseless as a cat&rsquo;s. They had need to be, indeed,
for the hearing of the walrus is keen. There was
not a sound upon the air but the heavy breathings
and gruntings of the herd, and the occasional
light tinkle and crash of crumbling ice.</p>
<p>At a distance of not more than twenty paces
<span class="pb" id="Page_263">[263]</span>
from the prey, the old bear stopped and gave a
quick backward glance at her cub. Instantly the
latter stopped also, and crouched warily behind
a rock. Then his mother crept on alone. She
knew that he was quite agile enough to avoid the
floundering rush of any walrus, but with him she
would take no risks.</p>
<p>Suddenly, as if some premonition of peril had
smitten her, the mother walrus lifted her head and
stared about her anxiously. There was no danger
in sight, but she had grown uneasy. She lowered
her head against her calf&rsquo;s plump flank, and started
to push him down the slope toward the rest of the
herd.</p>
<p>Not a dozen feet away, an enormous form,
white and terrible, arose as if by magic out of the
bare rocks. A bellow of warning came from the
vigilant old bull down below. But in the same
instant that white mass fell upon the cringing calf,
and smashed its neck before it knew what was
happening.</p>
<p>With a roar the mother walrus reared herself
and launched her huge bulk straight forward upon
the enemy. She was swift in her attack&mdash;amazingly
so&mdash;but the white bear was swifter. With
astonishing strength and deftness, even in the
moment of delivering that fatal blow, she had pushed
the body of her prey aside, several feet up the
<span class="pb" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
slope. At the same time, bending her long back
like a bow, she succeeded in evading the full force
of the mother&rsquo;s assault, which otherwise would
have pinned her down and crushed her. She
caught, however, upon one haunch, a glancing
blow from those descending tusks, which came
down like pile-drivers; and a long red mark leaped
into view upon her white fur. The next moment
she had dragged the prey beyond reach of the
frantic mother&rsquo;s next plunging charge.</p>
<p>The rocky slope was now in an uproar. The
other cows had instantly rolled their startled young
into the sea, and were tumbling in after them with
terrific splashing. The three bulls, grunting
furiously, were floundering in great loose plunges
up the slope, eager to get into the fray. The bereaved
mother was gasping and snorting with her
prodigious efforts, as she hurled herself in huge
sprawling lunges after the slayer of her young. So
agile was she proving herself, indeed, that the bear
had enough to do in keeping out of her reach, while
half lifting, half dragging the prize up the incline.</p>
<p>At last the body of the calf caught in a crevice,
and the bear had to pause to wrench it free. It
was for a moment only, but that moment came
very near being her last. She felt, rather than
saw, the impending mass of the cow as it reared
itself above her. Like a spring suddenly loosed,
<span class="pb" id="Page_265">[265]</span>
she bounded aside, and those two straight tusks
came down, just where she had stood, with the
force of a ton of bone and muscle behind them.</p>
<p>Wheeling in a flash to follow up her assault, the
desperate cow reared again. But this time she
was caught at a disadvantage. Her far more
intelligent adversary had slipped around behind
her, and now, as she reared, struck her a tremendous
buffet on the side of the neck. Caught off
her balance, the cow rolled down the slope, turning
clean over before she could recover her
footing. The three bulls, in the midst of their
floundering charge up the hill, checked themselves
for a moment to see how she had fared. And in
that moment the bear succeeded in dragging her
prize up a steep where the walruses could not
hope to follow. A few yards more, and she had
gained a spacious ledge some twenty feet above
the raging walruses. A second or two later, in
answer to her summons, the cub joined her there,
scrambling nimbly over the rocks at a safe distance
from the foe.</p>
<p>Realizing now that the marauder had quite
escaped their vengeance, the three bulls at length
turned away, and went floundering and snorting
back to the sea. The mother, however, inconsolable
in her rage and grief, kept rearing herself
against the face of the rock, clawing at it impotently
<span class="pb" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
with her great flippers, and striking it with
her tusks till it seemed as if they must give way
beneath the blows. Again and again she fell back,
only to renew her futile and pathetic efforts the
moment she could recover her breath. And from
time to time the old bear, nursing the cub, would
glance down upon her with placid unconcern.
At last, coming in some sort to her senses, the
unhappy cow turned away and crawled heavily,
with a slow jerky motion, down the slope. Slowly,
and with a mighty splash, she launched herself
into the sea, and swam off to join the rest of the
herd a mile out from shore.</p>

<dd class="r"><span class="small"><i>Illustrated Cloth 12mo $1.50</i></span></dd></dl>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The Backwoodsmen&rsquo; shows that the writer knows the backwoods
as the sailor knows the sea. Indeed, his various studies of wild life
in general, whether cast in the world of short sketch or story or full-length
narrative, have always secured an interested public. . . . Mr.
Roberts possesses a keen artistic sense which is especially marked
when he is rounding some story to its end. There is never a word
too much, and he invariably stops when the stop should be made.
. . . Few writers exhibit such entire sympathy with the nature of
beasts and birds as he.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Boston Herald.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;When placed by the side of the popular novel, the strength of these
stories causes them to stand out like a huge primitive giant by the
side of a simpering society miss, and while the grace and beauty of
the girl may please the eye for a moment, it is to the rugged strength
of the primitive man your eyes will turn to glory in his power and
simplicity. In simple, forceful style Mr. Roberts takes the reader
with him out into the cold, dark woods, through blizzards, stalking
game, encountering all the dangers of the backwoodsmen&rsquo;s life, and
enjoying the close contact with Nature in all her moods. His descriptions
are so vivid that you can almost feel the tang of the frosty air,
the biting sting of the snowy sleet beating on your face, you can hear
the crunch of the snow beneath your feet, and when, after heartlessly
exposing you to the elements, he lets you wander into camp with the
characters of the story, you stretch out and bask in the warmth and
cheer of the fire.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Western Review.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;More wonderful animal tales such as only Mr. Roberts can relate.
With accurate knowledge of the exiled beasts and a vivid imagination,

The antagonistic feelings that exist beneath the shaggy coats,
and the methods of stealthy warfare of wild beasts, are all minutely
described and the enemies illustrated.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Book News Monthly.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;It is surprising how much of the wilderness his wistful eye discovers
in a Central Park buffalo yard. For this gift of vision the book will
be read, a vision with its reminder of the scent of dark forests of fir,
the awful and majestic loneliness of sky-towering peaks, the roar of
the breakers and salty smell of the sea, the whispering silences of the
forests. We rise from its pages with the breath of the open spaces in
our lungs.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Boston Transcript.</i></p>
